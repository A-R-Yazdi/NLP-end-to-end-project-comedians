€]q (Xô  [theme music: orchestral hip-hop] [crowd roars] Whatâ€™s up? Davis, whatâ€™s up? Iâ€™m home. I had to bring it back here. Netflix said, â€œWhere do you want to do the special? LA, Chicago, New York?â€ I was like, â€œNah, son. Davis California.â€ [cheering, whooping] This has, umâ€¦ This has been a very good year for me. I recently got married, you guys. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. I need the claps. Itâ€™s a very heavy ring. Very heavy. It was a reverse Lord of the Rings situation. I got a ring and then lost my powers, which is a very different Lord of the Rings. â€œListening? Compromise? Take the ring, Sam.â€ The movie is done in eight minutes. Itâ€™s not a 90-hour saga. We just celebrated our one-year anniversary, so itâ€™s one year down, forever to go. Which is terrifying to say. But you know whatâ€™s great? Now, itâ€™s just kind of liberating. Because I donâ€™t give a fuck about any of my single friends. I donâ€™t care about any of you and it feels great. Because you guys are at home, just swiping for love, and complaining. â€œOh, how do you find people?â€ â€œDimples? Off with his head!â€ Like a god-damn emperor. â€œBrunettes? Not for me.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYou work at Subway. You donâ€™t deserve so much choice.â€ Weâ€™re getting soft.qXÀ  You realize my parents physically never saw each other? Thirty years ago in a town in India, population 990,000 â€“ thatâ€™s a small town â€“ my dad heard a buzz in the streets about this woman named Seema, my mom. And, like, Seema was that chick, you guys. In â€™82, Seema could getâ€¦ Look at that red langa. Killing it! She was like the iPhone 8. â€œHave you heard of Seema? Sheâ€™s slim. Her family owns a camera.â€ My dad was like, â€œA camera?â€ So he runs to my grandfatherâ€™s house and lays it on the line. â€œIâ€™m going to America. I want to marry Seema. YOLO.â€ In ten minutes, the man married a woman he had never laid eyes on. You understand? Thatâ€™s Tinder with no photos. [laughter] â€œI want that for the rest of my life. I hope she has a good personality. Letâ€™s move to the US where weâ€™re the only people that know each other.â€ Iâ€™m so grateful for that decision. Najmi marries Question Mark, they come to the States, I come out. Popping out of your mom is like real estate. Itâ€™s all about location. I popped out here. Anybody brown, we popped out here, we made it. Weâ€™re the rappers that made it. Whatâ€™s wild is, I never even knew how the whole X-Men Origins story went down. Itâ€™s crazy, because we know nothing about our parents and our parents know nothing about us. â€œDad, your favorite color?â€ â€œStanford!â€ â€œWhat? No.â€ â€œNo, I want to know more about you.â€ â€œWhy? Get into Stanford.â€
And I think itâ€™s just that, like, immigrants love secrets. Right? They love them. They love bottling them up deep down, and unleashing them on you later when itâ€™s no longer relevant. â€œMomâ€™s a ninja, Dadâ€™s a communist? Why are you telling me this right now?â€ Every conversation with my dad is like an M. Night Shyamalan movie. Itâ€™s just 90 minutes of build-up to no payoff. [laughs and applause] â€œThatâ€™s the ending?â€
So my dad marries my mom, they come to the States, they have me, in Davis, California, but my mom has to go back to India to finish up med school. So the first eight years, it was just me and my dad. Just the two of us trying to make it in America. Minus all the unconditional love. Brown love is very conditional. In the photo heâ€™s like, â€œYou had better get all As.â€ Like, letâ€™s be real. I grew up here. Like, Pioneerâ€¦ I grew up here. Yeah. [huge cheer] But Davis was, like, super white. Kind of like tonight. [laughter]
Roll call was a problem. It was a big deal for a lot of us. â€“ Like, whatâ€™s your name? â€“ Jasura. Okay. What would you get? â€“ Jasuriah. â€“ Jasuriah? Yeah. I would get, like, â€œHanson Minajaâ€¦â€ â€œSahan Minha.â€ â€œSaddam Hussein.â€ It was my English teacher. â€œIâ€™m not Saddam.â€ â€“ Whatâ€™s your name? â€“ Biju. â€“ What would you get? â€“ A blank stare. A blank stare? Iâ€™m the only brown kid at school, Dad is the only brown guy at work. In a weird way that brings us together, and we have to do everything together. Try to understand immigrant fathers.
I still canâ€™t understand some of you. There are uncles here. None of you guys are smiling. I donâ€™t get it. Youâ€™re going to die. Laugh. Why arenâ€™t you laughing? Youâ€™re always stressed and always tired. You could wake up any immigrant father from a 12-hour nap, and theyâ€™d sayâ€¦ [angry yawn] â€œWhy do I have to pay taxes?â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œJesusâ€¦â€ Weâ€™d do everythingâ€¦
I remember being in the grocery store. And weâ€™d be walking through the aisles, and my dad would pick up yogurt. â€œAh, yogurt.â€ Or milk. Just like, â€œAh.â€ And Iâ€™d look at him and be like, â€œOh, man. Dad hates yogurt.â€ [laughter] â€œHe hates milk.â€ But I get that look, now. Life is tough and sometimes you donâ€™t know what youâ€™re doing. He has a little kid and Iâ€™m not making his life any easier. Iâ€™m picking up soda and Iâ€™m like, â€œAh!â€ â€œDonâ€™t do that.â€ â€œIâ€™m going to live forever!â€ Then I would trip on my Velcro shoes and I would drop the soda and it would explode. And then my dad would do what most brown parents do. He would check to see if the coast is clearâ€¦ and heâ€™d slap the shit out of me. [laughter] I love it. Thank you. Thank you. Pockets were acknowledging that. And for the liberal white guilt, immigrants arenâ€™t going to hit their children the way you do. Americans hit on the arm and bruise the body. Immigrants slap your face and bruise your soul. Itâ€™s Guantanamo of the mind. And I know some of you guys are like, â€œHey, this is Davis, okay? I listen to NPR. Ira Glass says children are our future.â€qX  Have you seen the show called The Slap? This is a real show on NBC. This is a real show about a white kid that gets slapped at a birthday party. Are you fucking kidding? Thirteen episodes for this kid? Are you kidding me? Do you know when brown kids get slapped? Every brown birthday party. And usually itâ€™s the kid whose birthday it is, and we stand there and point and laugh. We go, â€œAh, Biju got slapped on his birthday!â€ And thatâ€™s what makes us tough and resilient. Itâ€™s why we become cardiologists and win spelling bees. Slapping is important. It elevates your game.
You ever seen an Indian kid win a spelling bee? Incredible! Ice water in the veins. [laughter] That kid wonâ€™t choke on camera. Heâ€™s been slapped on camera. â€“ Of course he can spell â€œknaidelâ€. â€“ Knaidel. Look at that face. Nothing. Nothing! Heâ€™s 12 years old. Nothing! This kid just won $30,000 cash. Nothing. People ask, â€œWhere does that come from?â€ Look at this kidâ€™s parents. Your son just won the Scripps National Spelling Bee. Look at his brother. His brother is like, â€œIâ€™m fucked. Iâ€™m fucked. The bar is way too high. I should kill myself.â€ People say, â€œWhereâ€™s Bobby Jindal from?â€ Thatâ€™s where he comes from. That is an Indian sociopath. [raucous laughter]qX|  I know what happens when I talk about this. People say, â€œYour parents donâ€™t love you.â€ I think our parents love us. We have great fathers. I just think our fathers didnâ€™t download all the great dad software. There are just a few apps missing. Birthdays arenâ€™t their thing. Every immigrant father feels like if they brought you to the USâ€¦ Happy Birthday. Starbucks, Wi-Fi, freeways, happy birthday. No more birthdays. Go be president. At an interview, this lady said, â€œDescribe your earliest birthday memory.â€ I was like, â€œDo I have to?â€ So Iâ€™m six, Iâ€™m turning seven. My dad wakes me up super early in the morning. â€œHasan, get up! Get in the Camry.â€ The immigrant car of choice. We get in the Camry, weâ€™re driving from Davis to Sacramento. Thereâ€™s one mall in the entire area. Arden. We get to this intersection, and I look to my left, and itâ€™s the one place every kid dreams about. Toys â€˜Râ€™ Us. I was like, â€œOh, shit! Dad saw the Toys â€˜Râ€™ Us catalog on my wall. He saw my vision board. He saw the blue BMX bike I wanted. Heâ€™s here to surprise me. Turn left. Turn left. Turnâ€¦ left.â€ Then he turns right, and Iâ€™m like, â€œHome Depot? No!â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œWhy are we here? Do you know what day it is?â€ â€œItâ€™s Saturday.â€ â€œNo, itâ€™s my birthday. Did you forget?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œHasan, how could I forget that itâ€™s your birthday? Thatâ€™s why I brought you here. So you could pick the door handle for the bathroom.â€ [laughter] And I was like, â€œWhy donâ€™t you have me pick out the toilet? You are shitting on my dreams.â€ I didnâ€™t say that. I would have gotten a slap. I wanted to say that.qX  Thatâ€™s when I realized thereâ€™s a generational gap between us and our parents. Youâ€™re going to fight with your parents, and thereâ€™s a finite number of hands you can play. You know about this. Not going to be a doctor? Thatâ€™s a hand. Marry a white girl? Boom! Thatâ€™s a big hand. [laughter, applause] I could have been like, â€œDad, fight me. I want that bike.â€ But I was like, â€œHang on to your cards. Youâ€™ll need them later.â€ Like, I had vision as a six-year-old. And my mom, she would come and visit, and just kill the mom game. One year, she came to school and brought me a Ghostbusters proton pack. The wheelie thing, the backpack, the gun that catches ghostsâ€¦ Literally shut Pioneer down. Kids were losing their minds. â€œWhat? Saddam Husseinâ€™s a Ghostbuster?â€ â€œYeah, Iâ€™m a brown Ghostbuster. Deal with it.â€ One of the happiest days of my life. But then she would go back to India. Thatâ€™s when I realized I donâ€™t want a toy. I just want my mom. I want to be a family. I was very emo. I was like Drake. I missed that girl. â€œWhen is she coming back? I need her in my life. I need her. I need that girl. I need that girl in my life. I need her, Dad. She used to call me on my phone.â€ My dadâ€™s like, â€œWhen the visa comes through.â€ â€œWhen the visa comes through.â€qX3  Itâ€™s a big deal. I donâ€™t care what anyone says. Itâ€™s difficult to get in this country. Itâ€™s not like a broken condom where youâ€™re like, â€œIâ€™m in!â€ [laughter] Eight years. August 11th, 1993. Iâ€™m so excited. I put on my Ghostbusters proton pack. Iâ€™m standing there. Dad goes, â€œPut on Indian clothes.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œAlright. I can be an Indian ghostbuster.â€ I put on a Salwar Kameez. Iâ€™m standing there. Door opens. Dad walks through. Mom walks through. And then immediately behind my mom, is this little brown girl with a mushroom cut. She runs up to me and hugs me. â€œHasan bhai!â€ And Iâ€™m in full hover-hands mode, because I have no idea who this person is. What happened was, my dad would go back and forth to India to visit my mom, and during one trip he knocked her up. [shocked laughter] And I had a sister. But no one told me about it. [uproarious laughter] Remember how I told you that immigrants love secrets? This is a secret that nobody told me! He says, â€œHug her.â€ â€œYou brought her out like Maury for immigrants.â€ â€œHasan, you are the brother.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, no!â€ She was breakdancing, and Iâ€™m like, â€œWho the fuck are you?â€ â€œYou donâ€™t know me?â€ â€œIâ€™ve no idea who you are.â€ I hated that brown girl so much. I was like, â€œBuild that wall.â€ I was like a little Republican. I was like, â€œI get it.â€ I remember leveling with my parents at the dinner table. â€œLook, Mom, Dad, letâ€™s just be real. Oh, my God, these brown peopleâ€¦ Oh, jeez. Coming into our houseâ€¦ eating our Fruit Roll-Upsâ€¦ they donâ€™t speak the languageâ€¦ I say we tell them to go back where they came from.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œYou canâ€™t say that. Weâ€™re family.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œNo, thatâ€™s on you and Mom. You guys decided to get your Angelina Jolie on, and bring over this FOB. Thatâ€™s on you, thatâ€™s not on me.â€ Why do you do this to your daughters? Every single brown mother makes your daughter quinceaÃ±era dress, chop cuts. Why? Princess from here down, Toad from here up. Iâ€™ve got this shit following me around on the playground. â€œHasan bhai!â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYo, kick rocks!â€ I go play tetherball. â€œHasan bhai!â€ â€œGet lost!â€ Eventually, I run to the boysâ€™ bathroom. She follows me into the bathroom. â€œHasan bhai!â€ All the kids at the urinal are like, â€œUh! Whatâ€™s Hasan-bye?â€ I went to school with a bunch of Ryan Lochtes. Just all traps. [slow, stupid voice] â€œUh, I donâ€™t understand other cultures, bro. What is that? What does it mean?â€ Itâ€™s a term of endearment in my culture, meaning â€œbrotherâ€. â€œShut up, Cody!â€ I took that anger and channeled it at her. I was like, â€œHey! Youâ€™re not my sister.â€ [gasps in audience] But she couldnâ€™t understand English. [laughter, applause] But she got what I was saying. She starts crying and runs out. I was like, â€œNo! Sheâ€™s going to tell Dad.â€ Letâ€™s focus on whatâ€™s important here. But she didnâ€™t. And my dadâ€¦ It was her first birthday in the US. She was turning five. So for her first birthday, he wanted it to be special. I can imagine being a father, missing your daughterâ€™s first steps, her first time saying â€œDadaâ€¦â€ Thatâ€™s a hard thing. So for her birthday, he brings everyone into the living room. He drags in this big box and goes, â€œAisha, open the box.â€ She cuts open the box and unfurls one of the flaps, and I see â€œToys â€˜Râ€™ Usâ€ emblazoned on one of the flaps. And he reaches in, and pulls out a beautiful, blue BMX bike. [audience gasps] â€œHere you go, Aisha.â€ He looks at me. â€œHappy Birthday.â€ [shocked laughter, booing] Savage, right? Iâ€™m livid. Iâ€™m like, â€œYo, when did Home Depot Dad become Danny Tanner? This is bullshit. Really?â€ Iâ€™m livid. And Aisha senses it. Sheâ€™s like, â€œHasan bhai, why donâ€™t you take it out?â€ And as an elder brother, I felt entitled to that bike. â€œThatâ€™s my bike. Thank you.â€ Younger siblings, you guys are worthless. You bring nothing to the table. I see you getting mad. â€œHell, no. I have a personality.â€ Where do you think you got that from, dummy? Us. Clothes, culture, money. â€œWhoa! I have opinions.â€ No, you donâ€™t. And then you have the audacity to be, like, â€œHey, why are you so melodramatic?â€ Because I went to war for you. Mom and Dad was my Vietnam. And youâ€™re like, â€œEverybody loves me.â€ Itâ€™s such bullshit, right? Elder siblings, we walk through the world like, â€œDo people love me?â€ And youâ€™re like, â€œMom and Dad fucked up with you, not with me.â€ [shocked laughter] Sheâ€™s like, â€œTake it for one lap around the block.â€ [speaking Hindi] I grab those handlebars, Iâ€™m like, â€œFuck that noise.â€ Boom. I take off. Sheâ€™s like, â€œHasan bhai, come back!â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œEat my dust, immigrant.â€ Iâ€™m flying. I see a curb. Iâ€™m about to pop a wheelie. The bike goes left, I go right. And that beautiful blue BMX bikeâ€¦ Bam! It crashes into the cement. All the paint is chipped off the right side of the bike. I pick it up, and itâ€™s destroyed. I hear the patter of her chappals. Sheâ€™s crying, â€œHasan bhai, why would you do this?â€ AnimÃ© tears of innocence. â€œWhy? I gave you the first ride.â€ And Iâ€™m looking down at her, and Iâ€™m like, â€œManâ€¦ Iâ€™m being a dick.â€ Like, this whole time I was looking for acceptance from Cody, Corey and Coleâ€¦ [laughter] and I had it right here this entire time. Iâ€™m supposed to be her big brother, help her navigate the American dream and protect her. And Iâ€™m out here stealing her bike? This is fucked up. And Aisha hates that story. Sheâ€™s always like, â€œOh, my God, you are so melodramatic. You make me sound like a refugee baby.â€ Thatâ€™s true. Iâ€™m doing that right now. Itâ€™s not fair, because sheâ€™s not a refugee. And, like, she learned English. She went to an Ivy League law school. She does mergers and acquisitions now. She is the one percent.qX]  Meanwhile, Iâ€¦ I didnâ€™t go to grad school. I became a comedian. This is what I do. And then, when it came time for me to get married, I got married to a girl from a Hindu family. I heard an audible â€œOh!â€ Alright. Fuck. I heard you go, like, â€œUgh!â€ I didnâ€™t punch you. Damn!
So some of you guys donâ€™t know. Hindus and Muslims are like the Montagues and Capulets of India. Weâ€™ve been warring for centuries. Youâ€™re like, â€œWhatâ€™s the difference? You look the same.â€ So how do I explain this? Hindus and Muslims. So Hindusâ€¦ Hindus donâ€™t eat beef. â€œNo beef!â€ Right? And Muslims, we donâ€™t eat pork. â€œIs that pepperoni pizza? No. No pepperoni!â€ And then Hindus, they like statues. Theyâ€™re like, â€œOh! This is a statue of an elephant. Iâ€™m going to put this in my car.â€ [laughter, applause] Muslims are like, â€œNo statues! Calligraphy! Weâ€™re about the alphabet. We put that in our car. Weâ€™re different.â€ And then Hindus, they like cartoons. Theyâ€™re like, â€œOh, this is a cartoon Ganesh. Iâ€™ll just put this on the wall.â€ And Muslimsâ€¦ we donâ€™t really, uh, like cartoons. Weâ€™ve got to get better about our cartoon policy. Because of this weâ€™ve been killing each other for centuries. And I know the older generation doesnâ€™t like those jokes. â€œPakistan was created because of this reason.â€ I know, butâ€¦ I convinced my dad. â€œDad, I love her, she loves me. Isnâ€™t there something bigger that unites all of us outside of race, color, creed, class? This is America. We can choose what we want to adhere from the motherland. Isnâ€™t life like biryani, where you push the weird shit to the side? Why do we got to adhere to this weird shit from back over there? He agrees. Heâ€™s like, â€œThatâ€™s a good point. Fine. You should get married.â€ Thatâ€™s a Hall of Fame brown dad decision. Thereâ€™s brown dads here, like, â€œIf my son did that, I would shoot myself and then shoot him.â€ He says yes. We rally the troops, Me, Mom, Dad, Aisha, we get in the Camry, weâ€™re driving to my fiancÃ©eâ€™s house. And weâ€™re about to pull up and we get to the door, and my dad is about to ring the doorbell, when he says the sentence that is the killer of every brown kidâ€™s dream. He goes, â€œI donâ€™t think we should do this. Log kya kahenge? [audience gasps] â€œWhat will people think?â€ I donâ€™t know if you know, but every time a brown father says log kya kahenge, a star actually falls from the sky. [laughter] â€œI donâ€™t want to be a doctor!â€ â€œLog kya kahenge!â€ No! â€œI donâ€™t want to marry!â€ â€œLog kya kahenge!â€ Why? I bet you, when Mahatma Gandhi told his parents he was going to liberate India, even they were like, â€œLog kya kahenge! â€œStop marching. The British are going to talk shit about us. Why are you bald and skinny? Youâ€™re never going to get married.â€ And Iâ€™m standing thereâ€¦ on that doorstep. [applause, cheering] Wait, Iâ€™m standing thereâ€¦ on that doorstep, like, â€œWait, you want me to change my life because of log kya kahenge? Come on, Dad. How many times do we complain about racism in our community? All the time. Now the ball is in our court, weâ€™re going to be bigoted? Dad, I promise you, God doesnâ€™t like bigotry. Godâ€™s not like, â€˜Youâ€™re racist. Good job.â€™ No! Number two, you want me to change my life to appease some aunty and uncle Iâ€™m never going to see? You want me to change my life for Naila Aunty? Fuck Naila Aunty. Are you fucking kidding me? My life?â€ But I canâ€™t say that. Because Iâ€™ve played all my cards. So I canâ€™t say anything. Now Iâ€™m losing hope. Iâ€™m, like, â€œMaybe this is bigger than me. Why canâ€™t I put my head down and do what Iâ€™m supposed to do? This ainâ€™t Jodhaa Akbar.â€ Have you ever been trapped by the time you live in? Itâ€™s been going on for centuries. So Iâ€™m walking back to the Camry, then I hear a voice behind me. â€œOh, my God. You guys do this all the time.â€ And it is Aisha, and she is pissed. And sheâ€™s like, â€œDad, I did not fly out from Philly for this.â€ [laughter] â€œBeena is so legit. She has a PhD. Hasan bhai is a comedian.â€ [laughter, applause, whooping] â€œNo one is going to marry him. Get him married before she changes her mind.â€ She stepped up. She laid down one of her cards for me. She Phil Jacksoned that situation. She got all these people working together. Because of her, I got to marry the love of my life. Because of my sister. I canâ€™t believe it. [rapturous applause] For years I resented that brown girl. I hated her. But on that day, on that special day, I couldnâ€™t have been more proud to be her Hasan bhai. [applause, whistling] [whooping] [huge applause] [applause fades]qXu  You know, they say every generation is defined by a great struggle or tragedy. And itâ€™s wild that our kids will never know there was a period in time in this country where you had to make a choice between being on the internet or being on the phone. [laughter] They wonâ€™t get it, dude. Youâ€™ll never get it. You donâ€™t get it, man. You wonâ€™t. That was our World War I, man. Especially in middle school, if a girl called the house, you had to pick up the phone before your parents. We used to have landlines. Itâ€™s like phones connected to the land. And one time in middle school a girl called the house. My dad picked it up before me. â€œHello, who is this?â€ â€œHi, itâ€™s Alice. Is Hasan there?â€ â€œWhat you want, Alice?â€ I was like, â€œIâ€™m going to die a virgin.â€ â€œIâ€™m in Geometry with Hasan. I had a question. Can I ask him the question?â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œOkay, Alice. Why donâ€™t you ask me the question, then Iâ€™ll ask Hasan?â€ Thatâ€™s the way our parents are. Ages zero through 30, â€œNo girls!â€ At 35, â€œWhy canâ€™t you talk to girls?â€ Thatâ€™s basically it. â€œAh, you kill me!â€ [applause, whooping]qXñ  Thatâ€™s the way our parents are, right? Our parents are like a firewall to the outside world. They disseminate information to us. Itâ€™s like living in North Korea. My dad is the leader of the household. So when 9-11 happened I was in high school. My dad sits everybody down. Heâ€™s like, â€œHasan, whatever you do, do not tell people youâ€™re Muslim or talk about politics.â€ â€œAlright, Dad, Iâ€™ll just hide it. This just rubs off.â€ Weâ€™re sitting there. Phone rings. I run, but my dad beats me to the phone. â€œHello?â€ I grab the second phone. I hear a voice. â€œHey, you sand nigger, whereâ€™s Osama?â€ [audience gasps] He looks at me. â€œYou can hear me, right? You fucking dune coon. Whereâ€™s Osama?â€ â€œHey, 2631 Regatta Lane, thatâ€™s where you live, right? Iâ€™m going to fucking kill you.â€ Click. And my dadâ€™s looking at me. Do you ever see your parents, and you see the mortality in them? Iâ€™m looking at my dad and I see all five-seven of him. And thatâ€™s when I realize Iâ€™m a darapok. Iâ€™m a scaredy-cat. We can speak two languages. We can speak at home and outside. I should have said something. I didnâ€™t. We sit down. I hear â€œthud, thud, thudâ€ outside. Me and Dad run outside and all the windows on the Camry are smashed in. My backpackâ€™s open. â€œFuck, they stole my stuff.â€ I reach and I pull out my backpack. Pieces of glass get caught in my arm. Now blood is gushing down my arm, and Iâ€™m pissed, Iâ€™m fucking mad. Fuck this, man! These kids know where we live, theyâ€™re timing this, so theyâ€™re watching us. So Iâ€™m looking in the trees, the bushesâ€¦ I look back in the middle of the street, my dad is in the middle of the road sweeping glass out of the road like he works at a barbershop. â€œWeâ€™ve got customers. Log kya kahenge? Weâ€™ve got to clean this up.â€ Zen! Brown Mr Miyagi, just, like, not saying a word. Iâ€™m like, â€œWhy arenâ€™t you saying something? Iâ€™m asking you, say something!â€ He looks at me and goes, â€œHasanâ€¦â€ [speaking Hindi] [speaking Hindi] â€œThese things happen, and these things will continue to happen. Thatâ€™s the price we pay for being here.â€ Thatâ€™s when I was like, â€œWe really are from two different generations.â€ BMX bikes aside. My dadâ€™s from that generation where he feels like if you come to this country, you pay the American dream tax. You endure racism, and if it doesnâ€™t cost you your life, pay it. There you go, Uncle Sam. But for me, I was born here. So I actually have the audacity of equality. Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m in Honors Gov, I have it right here. Life, liberty, pursuit of happiness. All men created equal.â€ It says it right here, Iâ€™m equal. Iâ€™m equal. I donâ€™t deserve this. [deafening applause] But as soon as I say thatâ€¦ He looks at me like I believe in Santa. â€œHasan, youâ€™ll never understand.â€ â€œIâ€™ll never understand? Dad, youâ€™re the guy that will argue with the cashier at Costco when he doesnâ€™t let you return used underwear. And now you want to be the bigger man? Now youâ€™re like, â€˜Letâ€™s be reasonable with the bigots.â€™ What?â€ And then he just walks back into the house with glass in his feet. And I honestly donâ€™t know who is more right. Maybe heâ€™s right. Put your head down. Be a doctor, get a house in the burbs, let them call them whatever you want. But isnâ€™t it our job to push the needle forward little by little? Isnâ€™t that how all this stuff happens? I donâ€™t know. The pendulum swings back and forth for me. And I know 9/11 is a super touchy subject. I understand. Because when it happened, everyone in America felt like their country was under attack. But on that night, September 12th, it was the first night of so many nights where my familyâ€™s loyalty to this country was under attack. And it always sucks. As immigrants we always have to put on these press releases to prove our patriotism. Weâ€™re auditioning. â€œWe love this country, please believe me.â€ Nobody loves this country more than us. I fell in love here. Six years old, Janice Malo. I saw her in the sandbox. I run up to her. First grade. â€œI love you!â€ â€œYouâ€™re the color of poop.â€ Thatâ€™s memory number one. The first time you experience racism? I was like, â€œWhat? Oh, no! Itâ€™s not rubbing off!â€ I was fucking terrified. It was like Inception. There were so many levels. I just wanted to wake up and be like, â€œOh, it was all a dream. Iâ€™m JGL. It was all a dream.â€ But itâ€™s not a dream, itâ€™s the universe telling you, â€œItâ€™s a Fair and Lovely world. Navigate accordingly.â€ In the third grade, Miss Anderson said, â€œWrite what you want to be.â€ Some kids were like, â€œan astronaut,â€ or â€œa firefighter.â€ I was like, â€œI want to be white.â€ [shocked laughter] â€œWhat do you mean?â€ â€œI want this part of my skin to be all of my skin.â€ And it wasnâ€™t like, â€œI hate melanin.â€ I love melanin. Iâ€™ve never gotten a sunburn. Iâ€™m blessed. [laughter, applause, whooping] But when youâ€™re white and youâ€™re playing the video game of life, and your avatar is white, you just get asked less questions along the way. You pop out. Boom. â€œI want to be Batman.â€ â€œWell, of course. Batman is white. Duh!â€ â€œI want to be president.â€ â€œDuh! Forty-four-and-a-half presidents are white. Weâ€™ve had a great track record.â€ And I know the privilege debate is very heavy for white people. I know you guys have problems. Iâ€™ve seen Girls. [laughter] My dad did not give a shit about any of this identity stuff. His rules with me were very simple. â€œNo fun, no girlfriends. Have fun in med school.â€ Which is a huge lie. It never gets popping in med school. Iâ€™ve never been to a club and seen nine dudes: â€œYo, whatâ€™s going on?â€ â€œWhatâ€™s going on? Residency, fam!â€ Never happens. â€œI got a career I hate from my parents.â€ Itâ€™s a lie. We buy into it.q	X1  So by my senior year of high school, I had yet to go to a school dance, I had been cut from the basketball team, and I had just got off this medicine called Accutane so my skin and face was peeling. Iâ€™m crushing life. Out here, killing it. No one did that. Donâ€™t clap. No one did that for that photo. No one ever did that at my school. Itâ€™s too late. But there was one bright spot, this girl named Bethany Reed. And her family had just moved from Nebraska to Davis, and we were in AP Calc together, butâ€¦ we had chemistry. She sat behind me, first day, sheâ€™s like, â€œHeyâ€¦ whatâ€™s your AIM screen name?â€ [laughter] I was like, â€œItâ€™s about to go down. Do you want it? I could give it to you.â€ Whatever I lacked in real-life game, my digital gameâ€¦ bananas. Status updates, away messages, sub profile, Boyz II Men. Donâ€™t say you donâ€™t like â€œWater Runs Dryâ€. I was a lover. Late at night on AIM, back and forth, back and forthâ€¦ You guys donâ€™t know this. Some of you guys are just in college, Snapchatting. Back in the day, we had to fire up the internet like goddamn cavemen. You know what I mean? [makes long, crackling, buzzing noise] [blows] If someone picked up the phone, â€œHey, get off the phone! Iâ€™m trying to talk to somebody!â€ Thatâ€™s how we would communicate. Late at night, back and forth, back and forth. One night she was like, â€œHey, come over.â€ I bike over to her place, white picket fence, McMansion, Ford Expedition, Eddie Bauer edition. [audience cheers] â€œOh, they made it!â€ Mrs Reed opens the door. Her father is this successful retired judge. Mrs Reedâ€™s like, â€œYou want brownies?â€ â€œYeah. Cool.â€ â€œHey, stay for dinner.â€ â€œWe just had brownies, but okay.â€ Weâ€™re sitting there at the dinner table. And now Mrs Reedâ€™s like, â€œHey, honey, we know so much about Bethany, but we donâ€™t know anything about you. What do you like? What are you into?â€ I was like, â€œWhat?â€ [laughter] â€œWhat do I like? Umâ€¦ Nobodyâ€¦ Nobody has ever asked me that before.â€ [laughter] â€œI guess I like acoustic guitar.â€ â€œYou should do that. You should follow your dreams.â€ [laughter] â€œMaybe I will. Maybe I will follow my dreams.â€ Then Bethanyâ€™s like, â€œHey, we always study at my house. Why donâ€™t we study at your house?â€ I was like, â€œIâ€™ve got to go.â€ What, invite you over to my house? You walk in: â€œWhat language are you guys speaking? Whatâ€™s that smell?â€ Iâ€™m not going to open myself up to that. But I was like, â€œNo, sheâ€™s different.â€ I hit her up late at night. â€œMom, Dad, a school friend is coming over. Everyone here, please be normal.â€ My dad is like, â€œWe are normal.â€ Killing me, you know what I mean? â€œHasan, weâ€™re normal. Be proud. You should be proud.â€ Who is proud? No one is. Youâ€™re walking around like a rooster. Iâ€™m not proud and no one is proud. We get there. Weâ€™re sitting on my living room table. My mom and dad are arguing in Hindi. My mom is frying pakoras. The fobbiest thing ever. Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham is playing on Zee TV. But itâ€™s too much. Itâ€™s all coming at this girl. Itâ€™s too much. Youâ€™ve got to ease your way in. Sheâ€™s from Nebraska. Soul cycle, yoga, then Zee TV. Donâ€™t just, like, go into it. So Iâ€™m looking at her, like, â€œDonâ€™t say anything. Please donâ€™t say anything.â€ She looks up from her book, and sheâ€™s like, â€œYou know what? This is really nice. We should do this more often. This is really nice.â€ And I look at her, and Iâ€™m like, â€œOh, my God. I love you, my white princess.â€ [laughter] â€œYou see me. I donâ€™t got to change who I am? I can be me!â€ So Iâ€™m going back and forth. Her house, my house. One night, weâ€™re on the living room table. Weâ€™re doing integrals. [laughter] She closes her book. Sheâ€™s like, â€œHey. Itâ€™s late.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œIt is late.â€ And sheâ€™s likeâ€¦ â€œI should go home.â€ I was like, â€œYeah, you shouldâ€¦â€ Why did you say that? That was your chance. Donâ€™t do that. I said, â€œWait, let me walk you out.â€ So Iâ€™m walking her out. She gets in the car. Iâ€™m about to close the door. She rams her arm into the door, leans out and gives me a kiss. â€œI love you.â€ Drives off into the night. Like a fucking G! Because she knew the rules. She knew the rules. No fun, no friends, no girlfriends. All we had was that stolen moment in my driveway. You guys are like, â€œI was getting handjobs when I was nine.â€ Not me. Not this guy. Not you, not you, not you. Not us. I was like, â€œAre we getting married? I have to change my pants. We are definitely getting married. When is the shaadi?â€ [applause]q
Xx  Now, my AP Calc class was a group of overachievers and my Calc teacher, Mr Pendleton, wanted us to live lives outside of school. So one day he gets up in front of the entire class. â€œAlright, you guys are all killing it academically but I want you to know there is more to life than just getting into UC Berkeley.â€ One kid was like, â€œI know, getting into Stanford.â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œNo, you have to live a life worth talking about, which is why Iâ€™m making it mandatory for everyone in this class to go to prom.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œAll 30 of us? Weâ€™re all going to prom? AP Calc? Us? Me, Jehovahâ€™s Witness girl, Korean exchange students, going to the prom? Thirty for 30? All of us?â€ Iâ€™m laughing so hard, Iâ€™m crying. Heâ€™s like, â€œHanson, this is not funny.â€ He walks over to the board, he pulls it down. Itâ€™s a bracket with everybodyâ€™s name on it leading up to the big dance. Itâ€™s March Madness for nerds. Iâ€™m like, â€œWhatever, itâ€™s not going to happen. He canâ€™t do this.â€ Weeks go by. Kids start getting dates. Three days before prom he walks to the board. Last two names: Hasan Minhaj, Bethany Reed. The class goes nuts. Theyâ€™re like, â€œOh! Theyâ€™re going to fuck!â€ â€œNo, weâ€™re not! Are we? No, no weâ€™re not.â€ I look at her, â€œPlease donâ€™t say anything.â€ She says nothing, like a G. [laughter] Bell rings. Iâ€™m walking to my locker. I hear footsteps. Sheâ€™s like, â€œWait up.â€ I was like, â€œWhatâ€™s up?â€ â€œOh, that was crazy back there. What are the chances?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œListen, you know, ever since my family moved from Nebraska, youâ€™ve been my best friend. And youâ€™re really special to me. This year wouldnâ€™t be the same without you. So I was wondering, will you go to prom with me?â€ [applause, whooping] I was like, â€œYes, my white princess.â€ As soon as I said that, I was like, â€œNo!â€ I had bitten off more than I could chew. â€œNo, wait. Youâ€™ve got cards to play. Youâ€™re good. Youâ€™re a good kid. Also, remember, parents respect honesty. Youâ€™ve seen this on TV. If you go home and are honest, your parents will be like, â€˜Even though I disagree with you, I respect your candor. Therefore I will grant your wish.'â€ I ran home, I was like, â€œDad, I would like to go to prom.â€ [speaking Hindi] Which means, â€œI will break your face.â€ â€œDuly noted, father.â€ â€œBethany, situation at home. Father doesnâ€™t want us to go to prom. Iâ€™m going to sneak out. I live on the second story. Iâ€™m going to jump off and land on my bike. Iâ€™ll bike to your place, we dance it up, and if I die, I had a great run.â€ You know? Youâ€™re going to die, so put it on the tombstone. â€œHasan Minhaj, 4.3 GPA, kissed a white girl.â€ What an amazing way to go. The night of prom rolls around. I put on the JC Penney suit. Spray on the Michael Jordan cologne. Six puffs, one for each championship. You donâ€™t want to overkill it with the MJ cologne. Donâ€™t be tacky. Iâ€™m scaling down the side of my roof, scraping my knees. I jump off the roof. Itâ€™s like 20 feet. I jump off, I somehow land, I get on my bike. Itâ€™s beautiful, the sun is setting, itâ€™s one of those gorgeous evenings. And Iâ€™m biking with my knees bowed out. So my slacks donâ€™t get caught up in the chains. Fast enough to get there, but slow enough to not get pit stains. Iâ€™m balancing the corsage. [panting] â€œAlright, go. Go. Youâ€™re good. Youâ€™re getting there.â€ [wild applause and cheering] I get to her house. I park my bike. Iâ€™m walking up to the doorstep, and Iâ€™m about to ring the doorbell when Iâ€™m like, â€œWait. 30 second time-out. Do you understand whatâ€™s about to go down? Youâ€™re about to go to prom with Bethany motherfucking Reed.â€ [applause] â€œThis is the American dream. This is what Dad fought for.â€ Ding-dong. Mrs Reed opens the door. She has this look of concern. And I look over her shoulder, and I see Jeff Burke putting a corsage on Bethanyâ€™s wrist. [audience sighs] And sheâ€™s like, â€œOh, my God, honey, did Bethany not tell you? Sweetie, we love you, we think youâ€™re great. We love that you come over and study. But tonight is one of those nightsâ€¦ We have a lot of family back home in Nebraska and weâ€™re going to be taking photos, so we donâ€™t think youâ€™d be a good fit. Do you need a ride home? Mr Reed can give you a ride home.â€ And I was like, â€œNo, I have my bike.â€ And I just biked home and played Mario Kart. Thatâ€™s the nicest Iâ€™ve ever been dressed, playing Mario Kart. [laughter] I wish I had said, â€œFuck that, Iâ€™m going to the dance.â€ I didnâ€™t. The sad part is, I felt bad for being there. Who was I to ruin their picture-perfect celebration? Youâ€™ve seen movies. How many times do you see that on screen? And itâ€™s not like they were yokels yelling â€œsand nigger!â€ I could let that pass. Iâ€™d eaten off their plates, kissed their daughter. I didnâ€™t know that people could be bigoted even as they were smiling at you. Itâ€™s hard when you see people saying they love you but theyâ€™re afraid at the same time. And I didnâ€™t know what that meant. [applause] Then the following Monday, during first period she finds me. Sheâ€™s like, â€œEverybody has been asking why we didnâ€™t go. Please donâ€™t say anything. Itâ€™s a generational thing. Please donâ€™t say anything.â€ And I look at her. Second period rolls around like clockwork. Mr Pendletonâ€™s like, â€œSo, lovebirds, what happened? Everybodyâ€™s wondering.â€ So Iâ€™m, like, â€œYeah, what happened?â€ Looking at her. She just looks down. Now everybodyâ€™s looking at me so Iâ€™ve got to improvise. I was like, â€œYeah, you know, I decided not to go. I mean, dances are overrated. Theyâ€™re a clichÃ©. I decided not to go.â€ Everybody in the class looked at me. â€œWow, you dick.â€ â€œYou stood up the new girl? Thank God Jeff took her. Youâ€™re a dick.â€ Thatâ€™s the last time we ever spoke. And you know, time has passed, and I donâ€™t really think about that day. I mean, I did write a show about it, butâ€¦ [laughter] like a lot of peopleâ€¦ [cheering] [more cheering, whooping] you move on to different chapters of your life. You have selective memory. Youâ€™re in college. Tools, Clear History. Out of college. Tools, Clear History. Never did that. Married. Tools, Clear History. Never happened. Second marriage, Tools, Clear History. Never happened. But for the most part, I actually think about it the way my dad does. â€œOh, you couldnâ€™t go to prom with a white girl? Who gives a fuck?qX+  At least your spine isnâ€™t getting shattered in a police wagon, though itâ€™s happening to African-Americans to this day. So this is a tax you have to pay? Iâ€™ll pay it. â€˜I canâ€™t date your daughter.â€™ I donâ€™t give a fuck, Uncle Sam. Take it.â€ But then I realized, wait, hold on. Why is it every time the collateral damage has to be death, for us to talk about this? A kid has to get shot 16 times for us to be like, â€œMaybe we have a race problem.â€ For every Trayvon Martin or Ahmed the clock kid, there is bigotry that happens every day. Because weâ€™re too afraid of the Other. Someone whoâ€™s not in our tribe. I wish I could tell 18-year-old me, â€œHey, man, donâ€™t let this experience define you. Itâ€™s good people and bad people. Irrespective of creed, class, color, find those people. Because love is bigger than fear.â€ I wish I could tell him that. I really believe that. [applause, cheering] I really believe love is bigger than fear. Fox News has taught me that. Fox News is incredible. Iâ€™ve never seen so many people with spray tans hate people of color. It is amazing. And Fox News is in New York. Theyâ€™re in New York. Daily Show, Fox News, five avenues away from each other. Thatâ€™s it. Professor X, Magneto, that close. Every day I walk past their building during lunch. Iâ€™ll see all the employees, Hannity, Coulter, Oâ€™Reilly, leave their building, cross the street, walk past me, and line up for halal chicken and rice. Iâ€™m like, â€œUhâ€¦ Racist Randy wants that red sauce.â€ Your brain can be racist, but your body will just betray you. I love that so much. All morning, theyâ€™re like, â€œMexicans, all lives matter, Arabsâ€¦ 12:01! Shwarma time!â€ I love that so much. And I wish I could tell 18-year-old me that, but I canâ€™t. I donâ€™t have a time machine. I canâ€™t tell him that. You know what the shitty part is? When you first fall in love, you get that first taste of the Heisenberg blue. Itâ€™s never the same after that. People here with girlfriends are like, â€œBabe, itâ€™s different with you.â€ Youâ€™re lying and thatâ€™s okay.qXé  But we had those first secrets. My secret was, â€œI want to be a comedian.â€ She said, â€œI want to be a journalist.â€ We promised we would follow our dreams, no matter what people would think. So I started doing comedy. I wasnâ€™t very good. Two years, three years, four years, six years, seven yearsâ€¦ I finally get a chance to headline a comedy club. Itâ€™s a big deal for me. Gotham Comedy Club, New York City. I did what a lot of early comedians do. I got on Facebook, I got super cocky. I was like, â€œYo, Facebook! Your boy, headlining Gotham Comedy Club. Let me know if you want some tix.â€ All caps. Like, relax! I sent it. I was like, â€œIâ€™m a headliner. Letâ€™s go to the airport. LA, Chicago, Nashville, New Yorkâ€¦ Iâ€™m flying Southwest. I was like, â€œI made it! Oh, hello. La Quinta Inn! Donâ€™t mind if I do. Free Wi-Fi? Why not? Letâ€™s see what the internet is saying about me. I open up my laptop, fire up Facebook, and I see this. â€œHey, um, long time no see. Youâ€™re doing comedy now. So cool. Listen, me and my girlfriends live in Manhattan and we were wondering if we could get some tix?â€ Question mark. Okay. [laughter] [sighs with pleasure as he drinks] [applause] I donâ€™t know if you know what this means. But, you know, if life gives you lemons, sometimes youâ€™ve got to make â€œrevenge lemonade.â€ Sprinkle in a little irony. Reply, son. Reply. â€œBethany, comma, enter. Totally remember you. Long time no see, indeed.â€ [talks gibberish in high-pitched voice] â€œSeven years. A lot of time. Listen, I would love to give you some tix, but weâ€™re going to be taking a lot of photos tonightâ€¦ [audience gasps, applauds] and I donâ€™t think youâ€™d be a good fit.â€ Send that shit! Send that shit right now! Send that shit right now! I jump on stage! I run to the club, jump on stageâ€¦ I donâ€™t even know what I said. I was like, â€œFuck that. Goodnight.â€ Boom. I go to the airport. We go from New York, Chicago, to Nashville to LA. I pick up my Toyota Camry L-motherfucking-E. Donâ€™t you ever forget about it. Cloth interior for life. Whipping through the streets of LA. â€œHello, headliner. What do you need?â€ â€œHasan bhai, Dad had a heart attack. Heyâ€¦ idiot, pick up your phone. I need you. Dad had a heart attack.â€ My dad had just suffered a quintuple bypass. So theyâ€™re rushing him to the hospital. Aisha goes, â€œCome home, now.â€ I was like, â€œI got a set at the Comedy Store. Iâ€™m going to do that, then Iâ€™ll come home.â€ And I did a set at the Comedy Store. And then I drove home. And I donâ€™t know whyâ€¦ I get to Kaiser and run upstairs. My mom and my sisters are crying. My sister looks at me, sheâ€™s like, â€œThey donâ€™t know what you did. I do.â€ Doctor sees me. â€œAre you his son?â€ â€œYeah.â€ â€œYouâ€™re over 18? Sign this.â€ I sign this waiver that clears the hospital of liability if something happens to my dad. The surgery is that risky. Iâ€™m signing this piece of paper and looking at him, and I feel like Iâ€™m signing a death certificate. His body temperature is so low that he looks blue. They wheel him into surgery and I hand the clipboard to the doctor. I look at my dad, like, â€œIf this is the last time I see my dadâ€¦ Iâ€™m saying goodbye to a person I barely even know.â€ And Iâ€™m waiting, hoping that he comes out of surgery okay. And somehow he makes it through. Weâ€™re in the hospital. I have to tell him stories. So Iâ€™m telling him stories about my life, heâ€™s telling me stories about his. So I tell him the prom story. He goes, â€œHasan, Iâ€™m mad at you.â€ â€œI know, I kissed a girl. Iâ€™ll never do it again.â€ [laughter] He goes, â€œNoâ€¦ why donâ€™t you forgive Bethany?â€ [speaking Hindi] He wanted to be the bigger person again. I was like, â€œWhy?â€ â€œYou know when I emigrated to this country in 1982, I thought if I let you go to a school dance, you would join a gang, get a girl pregnant and become a drug dealer, in one night. I wanted to protect you. Her family saw stuff about us. They wanted to protect their daughter. Everybodyâ€™s afraid of everybody. But Hasanâ€¦â€ [speaking Hindi] [speaking Hindi, voice becomes more insistent] â€œHasan, you have to be brave. Your courage to do whatâ€™s right has to be greater than your fear of getting hurt. So, Hasan, be brave. Hasan, be brave.â€ Itâ€™s a very beautiful poem. I think about it all the time. And look, there are some days where I can forgive that person. The past is the past. Tools, Clear History. Itâ€™s done. Other days, â€œNo, fuck that. This is House of Cards. Crush our enemies.â€qX•  I didnâ€™t know how to feel, until this. Pizza Hut new big pizza sliders are here. Get nine in a box for just ten bucks. Ten bucks. Match up to three ways. Three? Cheese! Big, delicious sliders, only at your Pizza Hut. And thatâ€™s how you make it great. Alright, soâ€¦ so this airs during March Madness. Everyone sees it. The night this airs, friends send me text messages. â€œHey, man, by any chance do you know how many pizza sliders you get in a box for just ten bucks?â€ [laughter] â€œNine!â€ â€œIs it true you can mix and match up to three ways?â€ [laughter] â€œYes, three. Yes.â€ A buddy of mine sends me this screengrab. â€œJust saw my high school prom date in a Pizza Hut ad.â€ #throwback. #itâ€™s a small world. #brilliant. To which I reply, â€œWe didnâ€™t end up going, though. Howâ€™ve you been?â€ #MrP. #Calc. To which she replies, â€œI know! Made for a better tweet though. Let me know when youâ€™re in New York.â€ To which I reply, â€œabso-fucking-lutely.â€ Now, against the advice of my therapist I go on Facebook, because she has a public profile. So I start clicking around. â€œBethany Reed.â€ Okay. â€œLives in Manhattan.â€ Duh, we knew that. â€œIn a relationship withâ€¦â€ I click it. [audience gasps, applause] â€œRajeshâ€¦ Rengatramanajananaâ€¦â€ She is dating an Indian dude, and this dude is Indian as fuck. Look at his name! Look at how big his name is. Itâ€™s so big, it barely fits in his Facebook profile. So big. Ten syllables. Ra-jesh Ren-gat-ra-ma-na-ja-na-nam. Are you kidding me? How many letters are in the alphabet? How many letters in the alphabet? 26 letters in the alphabet, right? How many letters are in Rajesh Rengatramanajananam? 25. Thatâ€™s one less letter than the entire alphabet. Come on! How easy is my name? Hasan Minhaj. So easy. She was like, â€œFuck that. Give me the Rajesh Rengatramanaâ€¦ motherfucking-jananam.â€ Like, â€œNo!â€ God is laughing at me. God is laughing at me. Now, against the advice of my therapistâ€¦ I make contact. Sheâ€™s like, â€œDo not make contact.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œTell me what I want to hear.â€ â€œNeed closure? Go for it.â€ â€œSee you next week.â€ Therapy is bullshit. â€œBethany, Iâ€™ve got a gig in New York next week. I would love to meet up.â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œYeah, letâ€™s meet up.â€ And I go from LA to New York, direct flight. Pizza Hut money. Iâ€™m walking through New York. Iâ€™m livid. Iâ€™m pissed. How is this possible? How is this possible? Rajesh Rengatramanaâ€¦ How does she make love? â€œOh, my God, Rajesh Rengatramanajananam, give it to me right now. Rajesh Rengatramanajananam, I want you so bad. Put your Rajesh in my Rengatramanajananam.â€ I was like, â€œStop it. Stop imagining her having sex with Rajesh Rengatramanajananam. Youâ€™ve got leverage. Walk in there, be cool. Walk in there, be confident. Be like this, dude. Walk in there and just own it. Be like this, be like this.â€ [laughter] [whistling, whooping] â€œWhatâ€™s up?â€ Do that with this, and then lick the lips and go, â€œWhatâ€™s up?â€ Iâ€™m practicing it. I get to the door, open the door, then I hear, â€œHey, Hasan!â€ Sheâ€™s sitting outside. She saw me doing this shit in the street. [applause] I was like, â€œOh, hey, whatâ€™s up? Is someone sitting there? Cool.â€ I just walk up and Iâ€™m like, â€œAlright, yeah. Iâ€™ll just sit here, cool.â€ Iâ€™m sitting there. When you see someone from your past, all of a sudden, youâ€™re that age again. So all that Kanye juice just goes out of my body. I canâ€™t say anything. Itâ€™s like the adults in Charlie Brown. I canâ€™t say anything. 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes. â€œDude, are you going to be a darapok again? Say something.â€ She starts talking about rent control and I cut her off. â€œBethany, do you know why Iâ€™m here? Iâ€™m here to talk about prom.â€ [laughter] And her face went white. You guys knew she was white, right? It went whiter than white. And I was like, â€œYou knew my situation. You knew it. I was ride or die for you. At that age, thatâ€™s a lot. You werenâ€™t the same for me, fine. Whatever. But what makes matters worse is, you had me socially crucified in front of everybody. You knew how hard it was for me, and then I was so insecure at that age that I couldnâ€™t date another white person, because I was afraid of not being able to be with them, because of the color of my skin. Do you know what thatâ€™s like? And now, Iâ€™m trying to pursue my dreams, Iâ€™m trying, but now youâ€™re writing about me, you act like weâ€™re cool, when weâ€™re not. Why do you do that?â€ And she was like, â€œI am so sorry. But you know we were 18, right? Like, I really wanted to go with you. But my mom, sheâ€™s very controlling. Do you know what itâ€™s like to have a parent that controls your life?â€ â€œNo, I donâ€™t. What is that like? Do tell. I would love to hear that story.â€ [cheering] â€œTell me more.â€ What? Sheâ€™s like, â€œI wish I could have gone with you. But I canâ€™t change the past. I never thought you would want to talk to me ever again. But the reason why I write about you is because I see you kept your promise. So even if you never want to talk to me ever again, Iâ€™ll always be rooting for you.â€ You know how you carry hatred in your heart about people in your past? â€œThey did this to me. Fuck them.â€ Damn them. In that moment, I let it go. I crushed it like a Voldemort Horcrux. [makes crushing sounds] [cheering, applause] But I had to ask her the question that weâ€™re all thinking. [laughter] â€œWhat about Mr Rengatramanajananam?â€ Sheâ€™s like, â€œI hit it off with this guy. We decide to move in together. I needed money for a deposit so I called my mom.â€ â€œWhat did your mom say?â€ â€œMy mom was like, â€˜No. You know the way our family is. So make up your mind.'â€ And I was like, â€œWhat did you say?â€ And sheâ€™s like, â€œI told my mom, â€˜Not again. This isnâ€™t high school. Raj is a good person and so am I. So Iâ€™m going to be with him because itâ€™s right. I hope you make up your mind.'â€ And Iâ€™m looking at her, and Iâ€™m so embarrassed. Iâ€™m like, â€œDude, what are you doing? Why are you hunting down people from your past like a psycho? [laughter] Youâ€™re not Liam Neeson. What is going on?â€ I realized, â€œYou donâ€™t give a shit about this person.â€ I care about what she represents. Growing up, we just want that co-sign. To tell them youâ€™re good enough. â€œSit here. Youâ€™re good enough.â€ But thatâ€™s not the American dream. Itâ€™s not asking for a co-sign. Itâ€™s what every generation did before you. You claim that shit on your own terms. Pizza Hut pizza sliders. Nine in a box for just ten bucks. Thatâ€™s you. Youâ€™re not Hasan Minhaj. Youâ€™re â€œHussan Minhajjâ€. This is new brown America. The dream is for you to take, so take that shit. Stop blaming other people. [cheering, whooping]
Now Iâ€™m standing outside the restaurant and I canâ€™t even concentrate, because I know sheâ€™s more evolved than me. Sheâ€™s like, â€œNext time, me, you and Raj should hang out.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œYeah, letâ€™s not do that.â€ And Iâ€™m walking to the subway station. But I take one last look at the restaurant. Just to see her one last time. To know that generational change is possible with one choice. I turn around and I look, but sheâ€™s gone. And I never saw her again. I did keep my promise, though. You know, I kept doing comedy. I never knewâ€¦ I never knew if I would do anything more than Pizza Hut. You know how you hit that point when your parents give up on you and move on? â€œLetâ€™s move on to Aisha.â€qX  One day I get an email from my manager. â€œWant to audition for The Daily Show?â€ Thatâ€™s not a question. Thatâ€™s a statement. â€œHey, audition for The Daily Show.â€ I submit a tape. I get a call. â€œJon Stewart saw your tape. Come to New York. They want you to audition. But, butâ€¦ you have to write another original piece. Can you write another?â€ â€œNo, I canâ€™t. Iâ€™m not Larry David. I canâ€™t do Seinfeld and Curb. Iâ€™m a mere mortal.â€ Iâ€™m walking back and forth in my shitty one-bed apartment, like, â€œIâ€™m going to die here.â€ And itâ€™s amazing how racism will always happen to you when you need it the most. Like changing the oil on your car. â€œOh, 15,000 miles. Racism.â€
So Iâ€™m watching the show Real Time With Bill Maher. Have you guys seen Real Time With Bill Maher? You know Billâ€™s demeanor. â€œHey, do you believe in God? Youâ€™re a fucking idiot.â€ And everyoneâ€™s like, â€œOh, the atheist prophet speaks!â€ So this clip went viral, him and Ben Affleck. Bill Maher is like, â€œThese Muslims, 85 percent of them hate our freedom. Weâ€™ve got to round them up, weâ€™ve got to contain them.â€ And Ben Affleckâ€™s like, â€œAre you crazy? Round them up, contain them? Dude, we did that to the Japanese. You canâ€™t do that. Am I crazy?â€ And I was like, â€œNo, youâ€™re not crazy. Youâ€™re my white prince.â€ [laughter, applause] Donâ€™t you realize what happened in that moment? We got our first A-list celebrity to back the Muslim community. We got Batman, baby! â€œHe may not be the hero we want, but he is the hero the Muslim world needs.â€ â€œBatman versus Bill Maher.â€ I write the piece, go to New York. You get it, right? The producer answers the door: â€œAudition with me. When youâ€™re ready, Jon will come down. Run it with me.â€ Weâ€™re walking down the hallway, and I see all these photos of the old correspondents that came before me. Steve Carell, John Oliver, Sam Bee, Jason Jones, Ed Helms, Steven Colbertâ€¦ and me? Keema roti, me? You know we donâ€™t end up this far. You know the way it is. Middle management till we die. Weâ€™re not on that stage, ever. I walk in and I see that Daily Show globe. I canâ€™t tell you how blue it is. And now Iâ€™m sweating through my suit. The producer is like, â€œWeâ€™ll run it a few times.â€ And I sit down and I get to the desk. Sitting presidents have sat on that desk. I sit down and weâ€™re running it, and Iâ€™m nervous. He goes, â€œHey, man, just slow down. Alright?â€ We run it a second time. Now Iâ€™m stuttering. And he goes, â€œHey, man, relax. Youâ€™re funny.â€ Which is a tell-tale sign of being, like, â€œHey, man. Youâ€™re not funny. You shouldnâ€™t relax.â€ And I can feel it. Iâ€™m choking. Weâ€™ve all been there. Everyoneâ€™s, â€œHow did it go?â€ Youâ€™re like, â€œPositive thoughts.â€ No, itâ€™s not happening. Youâ€™re not. You are choking. MCAT, DAT, youâ€™re going to the Caribbean, itâ€™s a wrap. You choked, right? Too real? Itâ€™s real. Weâ€™ve all been there. And I can feel this turtle head coming out of my butt. Iâ€™m really nervous. Iâ€™m pooping my pants. Iâ€™m like, â€œNo!â€ Then I hearâ€¦ [sings Daily Show theme] I know that voice. Itâ€™s Jewish Yoda. Itâ€™s Jon. Heâ€™s walking through the tunnel where the guests come, so heâ€™s just back-lit. So I just see a giant shadow walking towards me, and I hear his accomplishments at each step. â€œBoom! I am Jon Stewart. Boom! Twenty-two-time Emmy-award-winning Jon Stewart. Boom! I redefined political satire and comedy. What have you done?â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œHave you heard of Pizza Hut?â€ [laughter] [applause, whooping] Then he steps into the light, and heâ€™s shorter than I thought. And he has all this scruff on his face. And I look at him, and Iâ€™m likeâ€¦ â€œDad?â€ He had Jewish Najmi vibes. He shakes my hand. I could feel it, like heâ€™d slapped me in a previous life. I was like, â€œI know this hand!â€ He starts riffing, I start riffing. The prompter guy: â€œWhat are you doing?â€ â€œI got this.â€ I had it all memorized. One shot, Eight Mile. And I stuck my landing like a Russian gymnast. â€œThank you for the opportunity.â€ I tucked that turtle head back in my butt. â€œWeâ€™re going home.â€ I walk out the door, but then I hear a voice. â€œHey, man, where are you going?â€ And itâ€™s Jon. I was like, â€œOh, I live in LA. Iâ€™ve got to go back to LA.â€ â€œWell, Iâ€™ll see you Monday, right?â€ I was like, â€œWhy?â€ â€œWell, you work here. So Iâ€™ll see you Monday, right?â€ [huge cheer] I couldnâ€™t believe it. I was like, â€œOscar speech, go. Say what you got to say.â€ What I wanted to say was, â€œJon, this is one of the only things that Iâ€™ve gotten in my entire career that my dad actually knows.â€ [laughter] â€œSo thank you.â€ But what I said was, â€œJon! My dadâ€¦ knows you!â€ Heâ€™s like, â€œYeah, Iâ€™m sure he does.â€ I pinch myself. â€œYouâ€™re Hasan Minhaj. Youâ€™re going to be on The Daily Show.â€ I run outside. I call my girl. Sheâ€™s crying. I call my mom, sheâ€™s crying. I call my dad, he says â€œGood job.â€ â€œWhat? â€˜Good jobâ€™? Say it again. I canâ€™t hear you, Dad. Say it.â€ A car almost hits me. Iâ€™m, like, â€œNo! I canâ€™t die. Iâ€™ve got to drop the greatest status update.â€ I run upstairs, open my laptop, fire up Facebook, and then I see this. [audience gasps, moans] [quiet laughter] You guys see this, right? [laughter] Donâ€™t you know what this means? Donâ€™t you get it? Iâ€™m the cure for racism. [laughter, applause] I cured it. Alright, maybe I didnâ€™t cure it, but everyone has a purpose. Some people were put here to find a cure for cancer, or find a vaccine for Ebola. My life is definitive proof that once you go brown, youâ€™ve got to lock that shit down. [huge cheer, applause] Thank you. Thank you. Good night. Be well. God bless. I love you guys. I love you guys. Good night. I love you. [whistling, whooping]qe.
