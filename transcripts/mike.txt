€]q (Xj  Wow. Hey, thank you. Thanks. Thank you, guys. Hey, Seattle. Nice to see you. Look at this. Look at us. Weâ€™re here. This is crazy. Itâ€™s insane. So about five years ago, pretty much everyone who I know started to get married, and that was strange for me because I donâ€™t really believe in the idea of marriage. And that would have been fine, except I have a problem where sometimes when I think that I am right about something, it can be a real source of tension between me and the person Iâ€™m arguing with. And the reason itâ€™s a source of tension is that Iâ€™m right. And so I remember distinctly talking to my friend Dana, and she goes, â€œWell, you donâ€™t believe in marriage for you, but, of course, you believe in it for other people.â€ And I was like, â€œNo, I think itâ€™s insane, you know, for anyone.â€ And she said, â€œWhy?â€
And I said, â€œWell, first of all, it just seems doomed.â€ You know, 50% of marriages end in divorce. Thatâ€™s just first marriages, by the way. Second marriages, 60% to 62% end in divorce. Third marriages, 70% to 75% end in divorce. Thatâ€™s a learning curve.
Second of all, monogamyâ€™s impossible, or at the very least, not a sure thing. When I say that, I think people assume that Iâ€™m implying that men are incapable of being faithful. I think women are just as incapable, but for more sophisticated reasons, you know. I mean, with men, weâ€™re just really simple. We have a very simple sexuality. When I say that, my female friends are like, â€œWell, we like sex just as much as you do.â€ And I said, â€œSure, but itâ€™s different.â€ And they say, â€œHow?â€ And I say, â€œHave you ever masturbated while driving a car?â€
Number threeâ€¦ Iâ€™m never gonna be happy. Why would anyone want to be a part of that? I think thatâ€™s not brought up often enough. I, um, I didnâ€™t know that would be the reaction. Oh, no, thatâ€™s the hopeful part.qX'  The, uhâ€¦ I had one ally in all this, which is my friend Andy, and heâ€™s a comedian as well. Not only did we decide we werenâ€™t gonna get married, we actually tried to stop other people we knew from getting married. Yeah, we were pretty good at it. Like, we stopped or put on hold three or four marriages, you know. We wereâ€¦ we were pretty good. I mean, we werenâ€™t like the best in the world. Iâ€™m sure there are better in Europe. But we wereâ€¦ we were solid, you know. Like, so, like, for example, at point my friend Alex was about to get engaged. And so we just took him to dinner. And during dessert, we gave him a long, hard stare. We said, â€œAre you sure this is what you want to do?â€ And then we went cold to give him the sense of what it would feel like when we werenâ€™t friends anymore.qX;  So February 27, 2007, Iâ€™m at Andyâ€™s house in Los Angeles. And earlier in the night, I got in an argument with my girlfriend on the phone, and it was a bad one because I knew that I was right. And Andy was a perfect person to be with in this kind of a situation â€™cause heâ€™s the kind of friend who just takes your side regardless of whether youâ€™re right. He says stuff like, â€œShe sounds crazy.â€ Like, even if what sheâ€™s saying isnâ€™t that crazy, like, youâ€™d be like, â€œShe only eats whole wheat bagels.â€ Heâ€™d be like, â€œShe sounds crazy!â€ Youâ€™d be like, â€œThatâ€™s not even the crazy part!â€ You know. So Iâ€™m telling him about his argument. And he goes, â€œYouâ€™re right.â€ I go, â€œI know. Iâ€™m right.â€ He goes, â€œYeah, youâ€™re right.â€ I go, â€œI know Iâ€™m right. I got to tell her about this in the morning.â€ And I get in my rental car to head back to my hotel, and Iâ€™m driving out of Andyâ€™s small road, and Iâ€™m t-boned! I donâ€™t know if youâ€™re familiar with this term, uhâ€¦ This is the culinary way of describing when you are hit by another car driverâ€™s side at a 90-degree angle, like a t-bone steak. And in 1 1/2 seconds, Iâ€™m spun around, and I think Iâ€™m dead. No, wait, Iâ€™m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. And then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. I know.qX7  Let me tell you how this argument started. I met Jenny in St. Louis. My friend Andy and I were working for her company. They were performing for a bunch of wrestling coaches, which is really my demographic. I, uhâ€¦ No, I was very nervous about this. I was actually kind of about to go onstage, and I was, like, scrawling notes on my napkin. A lot of times Iâ€™ll write kind of manic notes on napkins or hotel stationary. And Jenny looked at me, and she goes, â€œWhat are you doing?â€ And I said, â€œIâ€™m writing my set list.â€ And then she goes, â€œI think itâ€™ll be fine.â€ And I was like, â€œNo, it wonâ€™t be fine.â€ And then she was like, â€œI think it will be okay.â€ And I said, â€œWhy do you think that?â€ And she said, â€œWell, you look so nervous, I think theyâ€™ll feel sorry for you.â€ But Jenny has this really soft, sweet voice, like the kind of voice where you kind of get away with saying anything. At one point, she said, â€œIt seems like you comedians are a lot funnier onstage.â€ Normally, Iâ€™d be offended by that, but in this instance, I was like, â€œYou are right. That is a great point. You are beautiful, you know.â€ She reâ€¦ she really was. You know, from the moment I met Jenny, I knew I wanted to sleep with her at least once. Stay with me. Uh, I meanâ€¦ I mean that in, like, in the most meaningful way. Like, that was the most that I was capable of in my life at that point. Iâ€¦ Iâ€™d jusâ€¦ Iâ€™d just come off a really long, difficult breakup with my college sweetheart where we were gonna get married, andâ€¦ and then we werenâ€™t. And then when we werenâ€™t, I was so heartbroken, I just kind of swore off the idea of marriage or even living with someone entirely, you know, andâ€¦ But from the moment I met Jenny, I just wanted to be with her. And I didnâ€™tâ€¦ I didnâ€™t think it was gonna happen.qXã  Like, I donâ€™t have that kind of confidence. I actually think of myself as a sex maybe, which is to say that if Iâ€™m seeing a girl, sheâ€™d think, â€œIâ€™d have sex with him, maybe.â€ You know, and Iâ€™mâ€¦ Iâ€™m not ashamed of that. There were periods in my life where I was a sex never. Or a sex with self always. Yeah. And often. Surprisingly often. Yeah, I just donâ€™t give off a great first impression. Like, Iâ€™ll give you an example. Like, this is the shirt I decided to wear tonight. Like, I didnâ€™tâ€¦ I didnâ€™t spill mustard on the real shirt and this is the backup shirt. I mean, this is my â€œAâ€ outfit. My â€œBâ€ outfit was naked. I like to dress down to perpetuate the myth that I might be a fixer-upper. Iâ€™ve reached this point in my life I donâ€™t really look in the mirror before I leave my apartment. I glance at it to make sure Iâ€™m not bleeding. You know what I mean? Likeâ€¦ But I donâ€™t stare at the mirror. If I stare at the mirror, I get angry. Like, I feel like Iâ€™m complaining about a bad call a ref just made. Iâ€™m like, â€œCome on!â€ â€œYouâ€™re blind if youâ€™re leaving the house like that!â€ And the ref is God, and the competing teams are my gut and my receding hairline. And itâ€™s a close game â€™cause my gut is large and my hairline is fast, and Iâ€™m all riled up. Iâ€™m about to charge the field. And the guy comes by with fried dough. And Iâ€™m like, â€œNext time.â€ You know, thatâ€™s how I go for fried dough, â€™cause I have a problem. I justâ€¦qXà  This is ridiculous. Can you follow me over here for a second? Iâ€™m gonna jump off stage. This is only in Seattle where someone is wearing no shoes? No shoes or socks? What? Who are you people? What is wrong with you? I would expect that behavior from this guy, but not you, sir, not you! What is this? Where do you think you are? From Seattle! Yeah, Seattle. So Iâ€™ve been going, uh, recently to a womenâ€™s exercise class. I-Iâ€™ve given up on having a traditional male physique. And so now Iâ€™m going for strong, independent woman. And, uhâ€¦ Itâ€™s going pretty well, you know. Iâ€™m not as good in the class as you might think. Sometimes Iâ€™ll kind of skip whole sections of the more difficult exercises when the instructor isnâ€™t looking. But then when she looks over, I always have to strike a pose as though Iâ€™ve been doing what everybody else has been doing. It reminds me of the Olympics. You know how they do gymnastics, how theyâ€™ll have thoseâ€¦ The girls will do those crazy flips and twirls. And every once in a whileâ€¦ And Iâ€™m not saying I root for this to happen, but sometimes theyâ€™ll fall, and itâ€™s ugly â€™cause theyâ€™re rolling around like, â€œIâ€™m in a lot of trouble. Like, I donâ€™t even know how I got here.â€ But at the end of that, no matter whatâ€¦ And I totally fall for it. Iâ€™m like, â€œthat canâ€™t possibly be the same loser â€œFrom moments ago. â€œI mean, thatâ€™s a completely different person. â€œThis person has much better posture, for starters.â€qX}  I really wanted Jenny to come out with me and Andy that night in St. Louis â€™cause we were going out to one of these famous Irish pubs where no one can hear anyone speak. And so I thought that might work to my advantage. I donâ€™t know, and, uhâ€¦ I didnâ€™t have the nerve to ask her myself, and so I convinced Andy to ask her for us. And, uhâ€¦ Pfft. Whichâ€¦ yeah, I donâ€™t know if that was the best idea â€™cause, uh, weâ€™re headingâ€¦ Weâ€™re in the car heading to the pub, and Jenny says, â€œOh, I left my I.D. at the hotel.â€ And I was like, â€œOh, we can just swing back and get it.â€ And sheâ€™s likeâ€¦ sheâ€™s like, â€œNo, itâ€™ll be fine.â€ I was like, â€œNo, it wonâ€™t be fine â€™cause itâ€™s St. Patrickâ€™s day, and thereâ€™s bouncers.â€ And she goes, â€œNo, itâ€™ll be okay.â€ And I was like, â€œNo, it wonâ€™t be okay.â€ And then we get to the pub, and it was fine. Like, the bouncer just kind of waved her through, which has not been my experience with bouncers. For me, bouncers are like prison guards. And for Jenny, theyâ€™re like birthday clowns like, you know, â€œWhat can I do to make your day better?â€
You know, and thatâ€™sâ€¦ Weâ€™re at the pub, and it had taken so much convincing for Andy to get Jenny to come out there. By the time she came out, she thought she was on a date with him. And, yeah, that wasnâ€™t the idea. And so I saidâ€¦ I had to convince him to fall away as the night went on, like the red rockets on the space shuttle. And eventually, she realized she was on a date with me, and she was not happy about that. But, uhâ€¦ But she warmed to me as the night went on â€™cause she was drinking, and then, likeâ€¦ No, by the end of the night, we were laughing and having a good time, and weâ€¦ I caught a break, which is we shared a ride back to our hotel with one of their friends, and she and I were stuffed in this little back seat together. And it was really quiet, so I could hear her soft voice. And she told me she had just come off a long, difficult breakup, and I told her about my breakup. And for a moment there in the back seat, it felt like we were holding up two halves of a broken paper heart, andâ€¦ We get back to the hotel, and I offer to walk her to her room, and she says, â€œSure.â€ We get to her door, and I didnâ€™t want this night to end. And so I build up the courage to lean in to kiss her, and she says, â€œOh, no, thank you.â€ Which I thought was politeâ€¦ But disappointing. I mean, thereâ€™s something about a rejected kiss that is the most personal type of rejection because youâ€™re really putting yourself out there. Youâ€™re just like, â€œI think we should connect mouths,â€ you know, andâ€¦ The other personâ€™s like, â€œI do not think we should connect mouths.â€ And those areâ€¦ Theyâ€™re two very different mouth agendas, you know. And then you just feel so stupid. Youâ€™re like, â€œI never should have suggested we connect mouths, you know.â€qXb  This is a sore subject for me. I have sort of a long history of failed kisses. Like, Iâ€¦ I remember growing up, like, when people started making out. Like, in my time in Massachusetts, it was in seventh grade. I rememberâ€¦ I remember it like it was yesterday â€™cause I was shocked. I was like, â€œPeople we know are just making out with other people we know?â€ â€œBut how?â€ You know. It seemed like an alien ritual where these two aliens just attach orifices all of a sudden. I was like, â€œI am not doing that.â€ And collectively, all the girls in my class were like, â€œThat is fine. â€œYou are not on the list. â€œYouâ€™re not exactly a first-round draft pick for our new activity.â€ I was like, â€œPerfect.â€ It seemed so gross to me. And it still does kind of. Like, sometimes you hear these homophobic arguments from these guys who are like, â€œI donâ€™t like when I see two dudes making out in the street.â€ And I feel that way about anyone. Like, making out is just sloppy. Itâ€™s like watching a dog eat spaghetti. Thatâ€™s how I make out. Is that right? Does anybody know if thatâ€™s right? Okay, good.qXq  Soâ€¦ In seventh grade, I was like, â€œIâ€™m not gonna make out with anybody.â€ And that was fine for a while, but increasingly, it kind of divided the class into two distinct parts. It was like, the make-out club and the non-make-out club. And these were informal organizations, of course. I mean, I would be sad if that were school-sanctioned, like, â€œwe call this meeting of the non-make-out club to order. â€œFirst order of business, Nintendo. â€œSecond order of business, why doesnâ€™t anyone like us? Meeting adjourned.â€ I donâ€™t know, it was a sad group, and we were losing good guys by the day. I fearedâ€¦ I feared that soon I would be the lone member of the non-make-out club, so I was like, â€œI got to try to get into the make-out club.â€ But it was a very intangible goal. I didnâ€™t really talk to a lot of girls, andâ€¦ There was one girl who sat in front of me in class named Lisa Bazetti who I had a huge crush on, but she was way out of my league. Like, she had many suitors. She hadâ€¦ I donâ€™tâ€¦ The rest of the show is in old English. Uhâ€¦ She doth had many suitors! Uh, no, she had many, you know, admirers. And there were three of us, really, and I was in third place in all the trade publications, but I had one advantage over these other guys, which is she had to talk to me on the phone every night about homework, thanks to alphabetical order. Bazetti, Birbiglia. One time I said something on the phone that made her laugh, and I was like, â€œOh, this is great. I got to do that more.â€ And one time we were on the phone, and she was laughing so hard, I remember so well â€™cause she goes, â€œMike, you got to stop. Iâ€™m gonna pee myself.â€ And I was like, â€œWow.â€ This was the closest Iâ€™d ever come to a vagina. So spent the next 15 years trying to get Lisa Bazetti to pee. And thatâ€™s how I ended up here. Yeah. Thatâ€™s how we all ended up here, in a sense.q	XÉ  Soâ€¦ uhâ€¦ So hereâ€™s what happened with Lisa. One time I built up the courage to ask her to go to the carnival with me, and she said yes. I couldnâ€™t believe it. Like, all of a sudden I thought, â€œWell, maybe this will be like â€œone of those romantic comedy montages. â€œWeâ€™ll go to the carnival, weâ€™ll get stuck â€œOn the top of the Ferris wheel, weâ€™ll make out. â€œItâ€™ll all take a minute and a half, and it will be set to Phil Collins song.â€ But I think that when youâ€™re 12 years old, you just donâ€™t understand certain things about your digestive system. You donâ€™t know that you shouldnâ€™t eat popcorn and peanuts and ice cream and cotton candy and then step onto a machine called the scrambler. Cotton candy being the most insane of these items. Itâ€™s basically saying, â€œWeâ€™re gonna take sugar, â€œwhich everyone knows is bad, but then weâ€™ll dress it up like insulation.â€ And Iâ€™m like, â€œIâ€™m not sure â€œwhat the selling point is there. Is it the sugar or the insulation?â€ Theyâ€™re like, â€œWe already sold it.â€ Iâ€™m like, â€œwell done, way to move the product before the information campaign disseminates.â€ I donâ€™t know if you have the scrambler here in Seattle. I imagine you might. It travels on a truck. It is a very mobile scrambling unit. The premise is very simple. You just sit on a two-person pod with the person you are in love with, and that pod goes in a circle, which is part of a larger circle, which is part of an even grander circle. As I understand it, it was originally designed as a medical device for constipated patients. It was called the â€œshits of pants-erator,â€ and it was wildly successful. And then it was co-opted by the carnival workers of America. Cwoa. And they saidâ€¦ They said, â€œWe like it, but we do feel like the name is a little bit of a turnoff.â€ And then one guy says, â€œWell, what about the â€˜I think Iâ€™m gonna die-eratorâ€™?â€ And theyâ€™re like, â€œThatâ€™s good, â€œâ€™cause it gets across the essence of how you feel â€œwhen youâ€™re on the machine. â€œPlus it has the added wordplay with diarrhea, â€œwhich is a nice homage â€œto the original intention of the machine, â€œbut we still feel like the name might be a little bit of a turnoff.â€ And then one guy goes, â€œwell, what about the scrambler? â€˜Cause it scrambles you!â€ Theyâ€™re like, â€œWe get it, Frank, but whoâ€¦â€ Frank is a maniac. This guy canâ€™t be stopped, but every once in a while, heâ€™s got a good idea. â€œBut who will be in charge of this dangerous piece of equipment?â€ And this one guy goes, â€œwell, I have a nephew whoâ€™s 16 years old â€œand smokes pot 24 hours a day. I feel like he might be available.â€ And theyâ€™re like, â€œhe sounds amazing. â€œWe donâ€™t even need to interview him. He sounds completely qualified.â€
I sit down with Lisa on the scrambler, and Iâ€™m feeling good. Like, sheâ€™s snuggling up close to me, and Iâ€™m thinkingâ€¦ Iâ€™m thinking like, â€œthis could be it. â€œThis could be where itâ€™s all gonna happen. This is very special.â€ And then they put that bar seat belt down. And the bar seat belt is not a reassuring piece of safety equipment. Itâ€™s not a Ralph Nader approved item. I donâ€™t think itâ€™s saved lives. I think the only thing itâ€™s ever done is in a scrambler accident, itâ€™s just sort of held someoneâ€™s esophagus down to the pavement, making sure that they are dead and that they cannot talk about the scrambler accident. First rule of scrambler accident, donâ€™t talk about scrambler accident. Thatâ€™s from scrambler club. Well, I knew from the moment they put the bar seat belt down that I was going to throw up for sure. And I even said to the 16-year-old stoner, I was like, â€œhey, actuallyâ€¦â€ And then he was gone. Apparently, he doesnâ€™t enjoy the second halves of sentences.
So then Iâ€™m scrambling, andâ€¦ As I am scrambling, Iâ€™m thinking, â€œI need to come up with a plan of some kind. Iâ€™m not going down without a fight.â€ My first plan was very simple. It was just donâ€™t look at Lisa, donâ€™t look at any other people. I was like, â€œdonâ€™t look at Lisa, â€œdonâ€™t look at any other people. â€œDonâ€™t look at Lisa, â€œdonâ€™t look at any other people. I need a new plan.â€ Andâ€¦ The new plan was I needed to tell the scrambler operatorâ€¦ That he needed to stop the ride, butâ€¦ The mathematics of the scrambler are such that the window of opportunity in which one can communicate with the scrambler operator is a very limited window. So Iâ€™m like, â€œI got to tell him heâ€™s got to stop the ride. â€œI got to tell him heâ€™s got to stop the ride. â€œI got to tell him heâ€™s got to stop the ride. Please stop the ride!â€ And Iâ€™m back! â€œIâ€™m not sure he heard me. â€œI got to say it louder. Please stop the ride! â€œIâ€™m not sure heâ€™s paying attention. I think he might be smoking pot right now.â€ The third time I said, â€œplease stop.â€ And then I started throwing up, and it was not unlike an oscillating lawn sprinkler, justâ€¦ Popcorn, peanutsâ€¦ Insulation. Really, insulating the pavement with my homemade carnival salsa. I did not look at Lisa. But Iâ€™m pretty sure she was staring at me because I was a spectacle at that point. I was spectacular. And we did not make out. I did not lose my mouth virginity that evening.q
XÑ  Two years later, it gets worse. Umâ€¦ Iâ€™m at the St. Johnâ€™s high school, what they call a cattle call dance. This is an all boys catholic school I attended where they would invite the girls from all over the state to our sweaty St. Johnâ€™s gymnasium like cattle, which is a friendly way to describe women, you know. Soâ€¦ Cattle shows up at 8:00. Weâ€™ll make out with the cattle. Cattle goes home at 10:00. Then we go out for burgers. Completely separate from the cattle analogy. It was a horrible affair. It was just like this room chock-full of sweat and hormones and drakkar noir and led zeppelin and making out. At this point, I was, indeed, the lone member of the non-make-out club, but it was actually worse than that â€™cause I had to lie to my friends and tell them I had had my first kiss â€™cause it was, like, this really tough, all boys school. And so when they would ask, like, â€œoh, have you had your first kiss?â€ Iâ€™d be like, â€œyeah, like, all the time. Like, everyâ€¦ every week.â€ I always feared at some point thereâ€™d be a follow-up question like, â€œoh, yeah? Whatâ€™s it like?â€ And Iâ€™d be like, â€œyeah, you know, itâ€™s just like licking an ice cream cone.â€ And theyâ€™d be like, â€œno, itâ€™s not. Itâ€™s like sucking on a rocket pop.â€ And Iâ€™d be like, â€œah, wrong frozen dessert analogy.â€ Iâ€™m at the dance, and Iâ€™m flanked by my friend Sam Ricciardi. And weâ€™re introduced by our friend Tom to these girls from his town. They were the last two cows at the dance. They were like, â€œmoo!â€ And we were like, â€œmoo!â€ And then Sam says one of these phrases I think weâ€™ve all heard but is very uncomfortable to repeat. He says, â€œyou get that one.â€ Which I know itâ€™s the worst turn of phrase, but Iâ€™m comfortable saying it â€™cause I know Iâ€™ve been on the negative end of that conversation where a girl says of me, â€œyou get that one.â€ And then her friend goes like, â€œoof.â€ You know, or even worseâ€¦ or even worse, like, â€œyou owe me,â€ which really hurts thinking of someone incurring debt based on my appearance. I would hate to hurt someoneâ€™s credit score, you know. So he goesâ€¦ he goes, â€œyou get that one.â€ And then Iâ€™m just fast dancing with this girl, Sandra, to young mcâ€™s bust a move. And Iâ€™m not great at fast dancing, but they had the strobe light going, so itâ€™s only catching me one out of every fiveâ€¦ Hey! So sheâ€™s losing interest, but at 1/5 the speed. And then Iâ€™m saved by a slow song, Stairway to Heaven, which is a classic make-out anthem. Led Zeppelin, eight minutes long. Whatâ€™s great about slow dancing is you canâ€™t really mess it up â€™cause itâ€™s just sort of a slow-motion hug. Like, the only way you could mess it up is if you just started fast dancing in the middle of it. Sheâ€™d be like, â€œwhat are you doing?â€ And Iâ€™d be like, â€œI donâ€™t pick up on social cues,â€ you know. But itâ€™s such a long song, you know, Stairway, so Iâ€™m just trying not to fidget. Iâ€™m sort of a fidgety person. I feared if I fidgeted too much, I might initiate the head tilt too early. I didnâ€™t know anything about making out, but Iâ€™d seen people do it. I could see thereâ€™s, like, a head tilt. I had heard there were tongues involved. And I could see that there was, like, some kind of space in between the two mouths. To me that was the most mysterious part of the whole thing. What is happening in that space? There is noâ€¦ You know, thereâ€™s no video documentation of that area. Itâ€™s like the giant squid of making out. No one has seen it alive. Theyâ€™ve only seen it washed up on the shoreâ€¦ Which is more specific to the squid side of that analogy, butâ€¦ So Iâ€™m trying not to fidget. Then with 1 1/2 minutes left in stairway to heaven, the song hits that crescendoâ€¦ All around me, kids start to make the tilt. Just a harvest of teenagers making out all around me. And I was like, â€œoh, no. I donâ€™t want to be alone anymore.â€ And I make the slightest tilt. And then Sandra comes in strong, and then itâ€™s an all-out mouth war. And she had artillery â€™cause she had braces. It was like a dog eating spaghetti and the fork. As this oral atrocity is taking place, all I can think is, â€œIâ€™m not alone anymore! Iâ€™m not in the non-make-out club!â€ And all I wanted to do was tell my friends, but I couldnâ€™t because up until that point, Iâ€™d lied and said that Iâ€™d had my first kiss. I walked off the dance floor, Sam was like, â€œhowâ€™d it go, dude?â€ I had to be like, â€œsame as always. Pretty smooth.â€qX_  As the week wore on, I started to convince myself, â€œwell, maybe it did go well, â€œand I should call Sandra, and this could bud into a relationship of some kind,â€ butâ€¦ I got her number from Tom, and those conversations ended up being very brief, you know. We didnâ€™t have a lot to talk about. I remember just being like, â€œhey, you like full house? â€œMe neither. Cool. All right. Later.â€ You know what I mean? At certain points, I remember getting this vibe from her, kind of like, â€œwhy are you calling me?â€ And I remember thinking, â€œoh, Iâ€™m probably reading into that one too much,â€ andâ€¦ And then she stopped calling me back. And I was like, â€œoh, yeah, I read into that one perfectly.â€ But I just felt so dumb about the whole thing, and the worst part is I couldnâ€™t even tell my friends, until one day I wasâ€¦ I was standing by my locker with my friend Tom, and so I said to him, I was like, â€œhey, whatâ€™s going on with Sandra? Like, she hasnâ€™t called me back.â€ And Tom has this knowing grin on his face. I was like, â€œwhat?â€ Tom was like, â€œnothing.â€ And I was like, â€œwhat?â€ Tom was like, â€œnothing.â€ And I was like, â€œwhat?â€ Tomâ€™s like, â€œoh.â€ â€œI talked to Sandra, and she said â€œyouâ€™re the worst kisser sheâ€™s ever kissed.â€ And it was so devastating â€™cause not only was it probably true, but I couldnâ€™t explain to my friends why it was true. I couldnâ€™t say, â€œthat makes sense. Iâ€™ve never done that before.â€ So instead I had to play it off. I had to be like, â€œyeah, that sounds about right. â€œIâ€™m a terrible kisser. Thatâ€™s kind of my thing.â€qX¼  So I lean in to kiss Jenny, and she says, â€œoh, no, thank you.â€ She agrees to go out with me in New York. We were both living in New York, and she gave me her number, and I typed it in my phone, and from that point on, she would be â€œJen, Irish pub, nice.â€ A few weeks later, I took her out to a restaurant I couldnâ€™t afford to show her how much money I could put on my credit card. Weâ€™re out to dinner, and she says to me, she goes, â€œeveryone hates me at work,â€ and I said, â€œwhy would they hate you? I love you.â€ She goes, â€œyou love me?â€ I go, â€œI mean, you seem cool.â€ I pulled it back. I didnâ€™t want to show all my cards. Just about nine of them. One of the other things that she said of note on this date is she said, â€œyou know, sometimes Iâ€™ll date two people at once, and that way Iâ€™m never let down by either person.â€ I said, â€œthat seems like a really smart plan. Like, Iâ€™d like to do that as well.â€ And she said, â€œIâ€™m still kind of seeing my ex-boyfriend, John, and you can see other people too, but you have to tell me if youâ€™re seeing them.â€ And I was like, â€œall right, sounds like a plan. â€œGot it. Break! I got to go find some more people, you know.â€ And so a few nights later, Iâ€™m in another city, and I do a show, and after the show, I went out to a bar, and I ended up making out with this random girl. Then a few nights later, Iâ€™m out to dinner with Jenny, and she says, â€œhow was your trip?â€ And I said, â€œit was great. I did some shows, â€œand then one night I ended up making out with this random girl.â€ And that didnâ€™t go over very well in the conversation. I could sense that something was wrong. And I was like, â€œbut Iâ€™m right about that, right? Like, Iâ€™m supposed to tell you if that happens, right?â€ And she says, â€œyeah, but it doesnâ€™t mean â€œthat I wonâ€™t lose interest in you.â€ And I said, â€œthatâ€™s a whole new clause! â€œThatâ€™s a twist! What is this, the romantic comedy version of the usual suspects?â€ I said, â€œare you still seeing John?â€ And she said, â€œsometimes.â€ I said, â€œwell, donâ€™t you see the contradiction in that?â€ And she says, â€œyes.â€ And it gets very quietâ€¦ Because we were falling in love.qX	  Three weeks into my relationship with Jenny, I built up the courage to ask her to go on a trip to Bermuda. I wanted to show her how much more money I could put on my credit card. Since I didnâ€™t have a lot left, we went to Bermuda â€™cause it was the off season. You can get these great deals online. Because as it turns out, when itâ€™s winter in New York, it is also winterâ€¦ In Bermuda, and, uhâ€¦ Jenny and I meet up at the airport, and sheâ€™s late, which is a big pet peeve of mine. I fancy myself as a professional traveler. Iâ€™m always two hours early, I have my pocket for my ticket and my passport, and I have laceless moccasins. I never tell jokes about bombs. Andâ€¦ and Jennyâ€™s late. And then we get to security, and Iâ€™m not making this up, she doesnâ€™t have a license or a passport. And I said, â€œwhat do you mean?â€ I go, â€œhow do you travel?â€ And she goes, â€œwell, â€œusually, they let me on the plane with my credit card and my work I.D.â€ I donâ€™t like to dwell on the differences between men and women, but I just canâ€™t imagine a scenario where a man would go to the airport with no license and no passport, and they would let him on the plane. But women get a pass on things like this that I find completely bewildering. I mean, if I were in charge of Al-Qaeda, for example, whatâ€¦ what I would do is I would recruit attractive women because theyâ€™re just not stopped under any circumstances. Although it would be difficult to recruit them because all they have to offer are the 72 virgins and, you know, the women wouldnâ€™t want that, unless theyâ€™re lesbians, although thereâ€™s an idea, you know. Al-Qaedaâ€¦ Al-Qaeda could recruit hot lesbians, althoughâ€¦ then theyâ€™d have to guarantee that the 72 virgins are also lesbians. I mean, what are the odds, you know? All 72 virgins are also lesbians, unless you think of sexuality as, like, a blank slate concept where the first person you have sex with dictates your sexual identity. Like the 72 virgins are like, â€œI didnâ€™t even know I was a lesbian â€œuntil I had sex with that hot lesbian terrorist. â€œAnd now thatâ€™s all Iâ€™m into. â€œI used to be into these Afghani guys who are so crazy, â€œtheyâ€™d die in a fiery plane crash to have sex with me â€œand 71 of my friends. But now I donâ€™t see Khalid in the same way anymore.â€qXG	  The point is, we went to Bermuda, and weâ€™re on the flightâ€¦ On the flight, and the flight attendant comes over, and she puts champagne glasses down in front of us. And she says, â€œcongratulations on your honeymoon.â€ And we said, â€œoh, no, thanks. Weâ€™re not on our honeymoon.â€ And she walks away, and Jenny says, â€œthatâ€™s so funny. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll ever go on a honeymoon.â€ And I said, â€œoh, really?â€ And she goes, â€œyeah. I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d ever want to get married in my life.â€ And I said, â€œoh, really?â€ I go, â€œme too.â€ I said, â€œis that based on a principle, â€œor did you have a bad relationship? Like, what was your first boyfriend like?â€ Andâ€¦ She told me about her first boyfriend Brian. It wasâ€¦ they were at the same bus stop when they were 16, and they would make out on the bus, and they were together for six years. And theyâ€¦ you know, their relationship got deeper, and they would talk about how they were gonna get married and spend the rest of their lives together. And I said, â€œthen what?â€ And she said, â€œhe died. He had leukemia.â€ And I said, â€œwell, do you ever talk about this with anyone?â€ And she says, â€œno, I donâ€™t really like to talk about it.â€ But these were the kinds of conversations we started having on this trip where Jenny was opening up to me, and I was opening up to her. And every night weâ€™d be up till 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning, and we were so happy, weâ€¦ At one point, I was like, â€œwell, we should do this again. â€œWe should go on another trip. And you could get a license or a passport.â€ Jenny said, â€œthat sounds great, â€œbut I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d get a license or a passport â€™cause they donâ€™t make me get one.â€ And I was like, â€œyeah, but itâ€™s the law.â€ You know. Jenny says, â€œyeah, I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ll get one â€œâ€™cause they donâ€™t make me get one, you know. Thatâ€™s how I feel.â€ Thatâ€™s how Jenny argues things. Sometimes sheâ€™ll just say, â€œthatâ€™s how I feel.â€ And Iâ€™ll say, â€œthatâ€™s not an argument.â€ â€œLike, weâ€™re not even in an argument right now because you donâ€™t have an argument.â€ And sheâ€™ll say, â€œI just won that argument.â€ And Iâ€™ll say, â€œthatâ€™s not even possible based on the definition of what an argument is.â€ And sheâ€™ll say, â€œI just won that argument,â€ again. â€œThatâ€™s how I feel.â€qX_  You could see how this could be a little bit maddening, you know, uhâ€¦ On our final day on the trip, we got into an argument about essentially nothing. She noticed there was a basketball court at our hotel, and she said, â€œwe should play.â€ And I was like, â€œyeah, but not, like, a game.â€ And she said, â€œwhy?â€ And I said, â€œwell, â€™cause Iâ€™d win.â€ And she said, â€œno, I think I would win.â€ I go, â€œno. I know that Iâ€™d win, â€œand I know that what Iâ€™m supposed to say is thatâ€¦ â€œThe guy says, â€˜Iâ€™ll win,â€™ the girl says, â€˜Iâ€™ll win,â€™ â€œand the guy lets her win, and then she likes him more. But I just donâ€™t have that in me.â€ And Jenny goes, â€œyou donâ€™t have to let me win. Letâ€™s go out and play.â€ And so we went out and played basketball, and I just kicked her ass. I mean, it was just likeâ€¦ It was just likeâ€¦ 10 to 1, you know, 11 to 1. I mean, I was having a good day, but still, I was just destroying her. And at one point, she literally said, â€œIâ€™ve never met someone whoâ€™s so obsessed with the score.â€ And I said, â€œthe score is what makes it a game!â€qX  So weâ€™re arguing this over lunch, and then, again, it comes up at dinner, and then weâ€™re still arguing about it at 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning about essentially nothing. And she said, â€œI donâ€™t understand why youâ€™re so obsessed with being right.â€ I go, â€œIâ€™m not obsessed with it. I just am.â€ I said, â€œwhy do you think youâ€™re right?â€ And she says, â€œthatâ€™s how I feel.â€ I said, â€œif you think Iâ€™m so wrong about everything, why are you even with me?â€ And Jenny says, â€œyou canâ€™t choose who you love.â€ Which is true, but it doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s good. I remember the first time I fell in love, I was in high school, and it was that first time where you fall in love, and youâ€™re just like, â€œthis is it. I found her. Iâ€™m 17 years old, and Iâ€™m done, you know.â€ Andâ€¦ Her name was Amanda, and she was, like, adorable and funny. And what was really exciting for me was that she was, like, a delinquent. Like, I was like this play-by-the-rules school citizen, and she had been expelled from her previous school for dealing acid, which I thought was a really strong quality. Like, at one point, she was like, â€œit was totally messed up because it wasnâ€™t even me. It was this other girl, and I was framed.â€ And I was just like, â€œawesome.â€ Like no one would ever frame me for anything. I justâ€¦ I thought it was like an opposites attract situation. She wanted to know what it was like to hang out with someone in student government who writes for the newspaper. And I wanted to know what it was like to be cool. At one point, I was like, â€œdo you want to write an article for the newspaper?â€ She goes, â€œI donâ€™t want to write an article. I want to do things people write articles about.â€ And I was like, â€œgood answer.â€
I find that when you fall in love, you tend to overlook certain red flags. One of them was that she would say really mean stuff to me, but then she would pull it back. Sheâ€™d be like, â€œno one likes you at all. Only kidding.â€ Or, like, â€œyouâ€™re like a nerd, but youâ€™re not even smart. Just joking.â€ Canâ€™t choose who you love.
Second red flag with Amanda was that she was a liar. And I donâ€™tâ€¦ I donâ€™t mean that in an offensive way. Like, lying was kind of like aâ€¦ Itâ€™s like a sport at the school I was at. I transferred from the all boys school to this co-ed school. There was this one guy in my class named Keith Robbins who was a legendary liar. Youâ€™d know when he was lying â€™cause he would lick his finger like a bookie, and he would dart his eyes from side to side. And heâ€™d go, â€œyeah, yeah, nice. Nice, you know.â€ And he wasnâ€™t even handling money. Like, I donâ€™t even know what this is about. And then he would lie about things that were sort of insignificant. Heâ€™d be like, â€œyeah, my uncleâ€™s Tony Robbins, â€œmotivational speaker. Yeah, nice, you know.â€ Andâ€¦ We found out that that wasnâ€™t even true. But even if that were true, that wouldnâ€™t be impressive to a bunch of high school students. But I think thatâ€™s the jedi level of lying, is you lie about little stuff, and no one notices when youâ€™re lying about big stuff. Itâ€™s like banking.
The final red flag with Amanda was that she told me not to tell anyone that she was my girlfriend. I know. Iâ€™m in the future also. I think we can all see now â€™cause weâ€™re so smart, and Mikeâ€™s so dumb, and, uhâ€¦ You know, I can also see, in retrospect, thatâ€™s a much bigger red flag than I perceived it to be at the time, but I was so excited she was even with me at all. And she said she had another boyfriend at home, but they were in the process of breaking up, but it was a bad time â€™cause his parents were sick. And so I tried to be understanding of that. You know, I went along with it for a few months until she invited me to meet her parents. And I thought, â€œwell, this is the affirmation that I need. Iâ€™m gonna be crowned as the main boyfriend.â€ And I drive my momâ€™s station wagon to Amandaâ€™s parentsâ€™ house, and I walk in the front door, and thereâ€™s Amanda, and thereâ€™s her parents, and itâ€™s going well. And a few hours go by, and this other guy comes over to the house, and his name is Scott. Iâ€™m assuming heâ€™s, like, a family friend or a relative. And slowly Iâ€™m noticing similarities between Scott and things that Amanda has said about her other boyfriend. Theyâ€™re both in their first year in college, and theyâ€™re competitive wrestlers, andâ€¦ Itâ€™s dawning on me that Iâ€™m hanging out with my girlfriendâ€™s boyfriend. And itâ€™s going pretty well. I mean, heâ€¦ He seemed like a nice guy. I could totally see what she saw in him. There was some consolation that when he would go in the other room to the kitchen or the bathroom, she would hold on to my hand, and she would say, â€œI wish it were just you and me here.â€ And I remember thinking, â€œyou could make that happen.â€ The way she said it was as though she werenâ€™t involved in the decision process, like, â€œIâ€™d love to, but the boys in corporateâ€¦â€
Well, the day took an even stranger turn when Scott suggested that we go hang out at his house. And I met his parents. It is indescribable meeting your girlfriendâ€™s boyfriendâ€™s parents for the first time. Part of you is angry for obvious reasons, but then part of you still wants to make a good impression. You know, youâ€™re likeâ€¦ â€œMaybe if this goes well, sheâ€™ll see that Iâ€™m good with adults in general!â€ As a side note, his parents seemed in perfect health. At one point, his dad even said to me, â€œhow do you know Amanda?â€ And I said, â€œweâ€™re just friends from school.â€ And I was so ashamed, and I felt so dumb. And I drove home, and I remember thinking, â€œI am never gonna let this happen to me again.â€qXï  Soâ€¦ Ten months into my relationship with Jenny, she invites me to meet her parents. And this was a tricky time. At this point, our relationship was intense, but casual, which is a dangerous relationship cocktail, and it was a hard thing to organize â€™cause I was away probably five days out of the week. And so we found a Sunday where I was coming back from a five-day stint in Texas, which was awful â€™cause it wasâ€¦ In Texas. And Iâ€¦ thatâ€™sâ€¦ Thatâ€™s not to say I dislike Texas entirely. Itâ€™s such a large thing to dislike. And, uhâ€¦ But that week it felt like Texas just disliked me, and I just kind of disliked Texas back to the point where I developed a small drinking problem, which isâ€¦ which is very popular in Texas. I was performing at a comedy club. Now, comedyâ€¦ I love comedy clubs â€™cause theyâ€™re sort of a high-low entertainment proposition. Like, in some ways, though, theyâ€™re the last bastions of free speech and the art of spoken word, and then some of them sell dildo straws, you know. Like, thereâ€™s 15 bachelorette parties coming through on the weekends, and theyâ€™re handing out gummy penises or whatever. Thatâ€™sâ€¦ thatâ€™s actually a thing. I didnâ€™t even realize thatâ€¦ I didnâ€™t realize that that was part of the female fantasy of the penis wasâ€¦ was the gummy quality of the penis. I feel like if I were in charge of the candification of the penis, it would be hard candy. And then ifâ€¦ And then, if you suck it down to the gummy part, then you just sort of put that off to the side. But Iâ€¦ but thatâ€™sâ€¦ thatâ€™s not my job. Iâ€™mâ€¦ you know, I leave that to the experts, but I justâ€¦ I just do the comedy part. But I was performing at this club all week, and after the late show Saturday night, I was approached by this bachelorette party that had one of these sort of novelty sexual checklist things. Andâ€¦ Iâ€™d been drinking all week, and, uh, I always try to be a team player, you know. So I was like, â€œwhatever I can do to help. I donâ€™t see how this could end badly.â€ And, uhâ€¦ The next morning, I wake up in the my hotel room, and Iâ€™m hung over, and Iâ€™m groggy. And I roll out of bed, and I run to the airport to catch my flight. Iâ€™m still two hours early, andâ€¦ I land in New York, and I get a cab to Jennyâ€™s parentsâ€™ house. And I walk in the front door, and thereâ€™s Jenny, and thereâ€™s her parents. And thereâ€™s her other sort of ex-boyfriend, John. And he wasnâ€™t front and center. Like, he was just kind of around, like, he was in the pool, like, wading and doing laps, like, that kind of thing. But I pulled Jenny aside, I was like, â€œwell, whatâ€™s John doing here?â€ And she says, â€œwell, he and I arenâ€™t still together, â€œbut when we were together, â€œhe became friends with my stepdad, â€œand heâ€™s been staying here at their house the last couple weeks.â€ And I said, â€œyou know, thatâ€™s not good. I feel like that gives him the edge.â€ Jennyâ€™s staring at me. And I said, â€œwhat?â€ She says, â€œyou have a hickey on your neck.â€ And I said, â€œI donâ€™t think thatâ€™s true.â€ And then I glance at the mirror next to me and realize that, in fact, I do have a hickey on my neck. And I say, â€œIâ€™m really sorry.â€ And she says, â€œwhere is that from?â€ And I said, â€œthere was this bachelorette party, and I was drunk.â€ That sentence never comes out right. I mean, thereâ€™s no way to deliver that line in a way that makes you seem even okay, andâ€¦ We start arguing, and the argument follows us all the way back to the street in front of my apartment. I didnâ€™t have a leg to stand on. I was like, â€œwell, what about John? What was he doing there?â€ She said, â€œyou have a hickey on your neck.â€ I said, â€œyeah, but at least I told you the truth.â€ And she said, â€œeventually.â€ And I said, â€œeventually is better than never!â€ And then she kneed me in the balls. I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve ever experienced this before. Iâ€™m sure half of you have not. Uhâ€¦ Itâ€™s like being electrocuted, except you donâ€™t get to die. Itâ€™s like you want to die, but you canâ€™t. And thereâ€™s a person in your face saying, â€œyou deserve this,â€ which they wouldnâ€™t even do in electrocutions. I think they would deem that as inhumane.Â  Even in Texas.
Jenny says, â€œI think that we should just break up. â€œYou know, itâ€™s not just this. â€œI mean, youâ€™re away a lot of the time. â€œAnd even when youâ€™re here, you work at night, â€œand I work in the day. I just donâ€™t think itâ€™s gonna work out.â€ And I said, â€œokay.â€Â  And we were apart for about six months, and I missed her so much, but I kept resisting calling her â€™cause I wanted to give her space. And every once in a while Iâ€™d get a glimmer of hope in the form of a text message from â€œJen, Irish pub, nice.â€ And it would just say, â€œhi.â€ And Iâ€™d write back, â€œhi.â€ It was the smallest form of communication two people could have with one another, but I think, in some ways, kept us together. And finally, on new yearâ€™s, I caved in, and I called her, I said, â€œhey, I really miss you, and I want to see you.â€ And we got together for coffee. And we hit it off just like we used to, and we decided we would get back together. We had a great period there, you know. I took her to get a license and a passport. First, we went for her social security card, and then we took that to the D.M.V. And then we mailed all of that to the government for a passport. It was like the triple crown of identifications. Jenny was wildly identifiable. One night, she was heading back from my apartment to hers, and she stops. And I said, â€œwhat?â€ And she says, â€œI think that we should live together.â€ And I said, â€œno, I really donâ€™t think thatâ€™s a good idea. â€œYou know, Iâ€™ve just decided, you know, as a principle, â€œIâ€™m not gonna get married or live with someone. Itâ€™s not personal.â€ And she said, â€œwell, unless we live together, â€œI just donâ€™t think itâ€™s gonna work out â€œâ€™cause we just donâ€™t see each other enough, â€œand I donâ€™t think that we stand a chance. Thatâ€™s how I feel.â€qX{	  So we moved in together. And one day, Jenny gets an invitation to the wedding of one of her friends, and she invites me to come along. And I said, â€œoh, no, thanks.â€ That doesnâ€™t go over so well. She says, â€œwhy?â€ And I said, â€œwell, as you know, â€œI donâ€™t believe in marriage, and so I donâ€™t buy into the flamboyant pageantry that goes into celebrating it.â€ She said, â€œwell, what do you believe in?â€ And I said, â€œI donâ€™t know.â€ She said, â€œwell, if you donâ€™t believe in anything, how can you not believe in marriage?â€ And I said, â€œwell, first of all, â€œyou know, it just doesnâ€™t seem necessary. â€œI mean, is itâ€¦ you know, â€œmarriage is an archaic institution â€œinvented in the middle ages based on exchanging property. â€œI donâ€™t want to be a part of that. â€œSecond of all, I donâ€™t even think we have â€œa common cultural understanding of what marriage even is. â€œI mean, one of me and Andyâ€™s friends â€œwas about to get engaged, and we were skeptical, â€œand we said, â€˜are you sure this is the person â€œyou want to be with for the rest of your life?â€™ â€œand he goes, â€˜yeah, I think so.â€™ â€œand we said, â€˜well, what if she gets in a car accident, â€œand sheâ€™s disfigured? Would you stay with her then?â€™ â€œand he said, â€˜maybeâ€™! â€œThat is not an acceptable answer! â€œThird of all, if Iâ€™m so in love, â€œwhy does it need to be written into a government contract? â€œAnd Iâ€™m not one of these like, â€œâ€˜I donâ€™t want government up in my businessâ€™ kind of people! â€œI think the government does a nice job â€œdelivering the mail and suggesting I donâ€™t eat poison, â€œbut I just donâ€™t understand why they need to be involved â€œin my personal relationships. â€œThen finally, if marriage is religious, â€œshouldnâ€™t I believe in the religion? â€œIâ€™ve been to more weddings of my friends â€œwhere the people on the altar donâ€™t believe â€œin the religion of the church theyâ€™ve invited us to! â€œSome of them even go to classes with the priest â€œin advance, to more elaborately lie â€œabout believing in a religion they donâ€™t believe in â€œjust to have a wedding in a fancy building! â€œThat is insane! Thatâ€™s how I feel!â€ So I explain this to Jenny. And Jenny says, â€œwell, if you ever did want to get married, I would marry you.â€ And I said, â€œwhy? Arenâ€™t you listening to any of this?â€ And Jenny says, â€œthatâ€™s how I feel.â€qXZ  At this point, it was 5:00 in the morning, weâ€™d been arguing all night, and we hadnâ€™t slept. I had to catch a flight at 6:20 A.M. Out of Newark airport to Los Angeles for a show I was doing that night. At this point, Iâ€™m overtired, and Iâ€™m angry, and Iâ€™m late. Iâ€™m stuffing my things in my roller suitcase. And I walk out of our apartment. Itâ€™s 5:00 A.M., that part of the morning before the earth even exists, before they program The Matrix or whatever. You walk out of your apartment, part of the road isnâ€™t even there. Thereâ€™s a guy with a laptop going, â€œwe need a road, stat! Whatâ€™s the code for building, tank?â€ You know, and I get to the airport. The news hasnâ€™t even started yet. Itâ€™s just an anchor looking around like, â€œwhat are you up to?â€ And I get to the kiosk, and I print up my ticket, and I bring it to the security lady, and she looks at me, and she goes, â€œwell, that ainâ€™t your gate.â€ Like, I guess they changed the gate, but the way she said it was as though I had participated in the decision of changing it. I was like, â€œI was not involved in this process. I wasnâ€™t even C.C.â€™d.â€ Like, as though I had gone to the kiosk and been like, â€œB22. Like hell Iâ€™m flying out of B22.â€ And then I photoshopped my own ticket, printed it out, and been like, â€œthis is where Iâ€™m going.â€ You know, Iâ€™m not that aggressive as a traveler, so I was like, â€œwell, where is this gate?â€ She goes, â€œitâ€™s in another terminal. You got to take a tram.â€ She points to the tram, and I start walking my roller suitcase, and I hear her say, â€œand you better run.â€ Like, I guess I was late at that point. So I started running. And the roller suitcase does not enjoy running. The roller suitcase was like, â€œI donâ€™t want to run. I have wheels.â€ And I was like, â€œI donâ€™t want to run either, but this is what we have to do. â€œI tell you what, when we get to the hotel, Iâ€™ll walk you in circles for a few hours.â€ Then Iâ€¦ I get to the tram, and it has that feature where it says how many minutes before the next tram arrives. And it says zero minutes. I was like, â€œperfect. Thatâ€™s exactly how long I want to wait.â€ But the tramâ€™s riding away. I was like, â€œthatâ€™s -1 minute!â€ Then it says ten minutes, and Iâ€™m experiencing that psychological downward spiral like, â€œoh, great, Iâ€™m gonna miss my flight, â€œand then Iâ€™m gonna miss every flight from now on, â€œand Iâ€™m gonna miss my family reunion. â€œAnd then Iâ€™m not gonna have a family, and then Iâ€™m gonna be a crack whore.â€ And itâ€™s like, all of a sudden, Iâ€™m a crack whore just because I miss this one flight. I can feel the cancer forming in my body in real time andâ€¦
I get on the next tram ten minutes later, and I run to the gate, and Iâ€™m sweaty, and Iâ€™m out of breath, but Iâ€™m on time. And Iâ€™m so relieved that I sit down in a chair at the gate, and I fall asleep. And I wake up to the sound of the door shutting. I jump up, and the door is closed, and I am on the sad side of the door. The happy side has an airplane and a pilot. The sad side is me and the Cinnabon lady. Normally, Iâ€™d be very excited if it were just me and the Cinnabon lady. Iâ€™m a big fan of pastries the size of a baby that have enough calories for a year. I think thatâ€™s an effective use of time. But in this instance, I needed someone who could communicate with the people on the plane. And the Cinnabon lady is not very well connected in the airline community. I was like, â€œdo you know these people?â€ She was like, â€œall I know is the white stuff goes on the cinnamon bun.â€ I ran up to the giant glass window. I started pounding on the window like in a romantic comedy. I was like, â€œDrew Barrymoreâ€™s character, come back!â€ She didnâ€™t come back, and I missed my flight. I got on the next one they could get me on. There was a stopover in Texas. You know how I feel about Texas. And, uh, I get to Los Angeles late that night, and Iâ€™d missed my show. Iâ€™d never missed one of my shows before, and Iâ€™m so angry. And Jennyâ€™s calling me, but Iâ€™m not picking up the phone â€™cause Iâ€™m blaming this entire day on her.qXÁ  I get back to my friend Andyâ€™s house, and I said, â€œAndy, this relationship is messing up my entire life!â€ And Andy goes, â€œyouâ€™re right.â€ I go, â€œI know! Iâ€™m right!â€ He goes, â€œyeah, youâ€™re right.â€ I go, â€œI know, Iâ€™m right! I got to tell her about this in the morning!â€ I drive out of Andyâ€™s small road, and Iâ€™m t-boned. Thatâ€™s the culinary way of describing it. In 1 1/2 seconds, Iâ€™m spun around, and I think Iâ€™m dead. No, wait, Iâ€™m paralyzed. And then I hear nothing. Then I hear the other car skid out and drive away. 20 minutes later Iâ€™m sitting on a curb. At this point, the police have arriâ€¦ have arrived, as well as my friend, Andy, and thatâ€™s when I start crying. You know how when you drop a baby on the ground, it doesnâ€™tâ€¦ Doesnâ€™t start crying right away because it doesnâ€™t understand the concept of dropping a baby on the ground until it sees your face? And then itâ€™s like, â€œoh, I guess I should be doing something â€œthat matches that. Waah!â€ Iâ€™m crying because Iâ€™m looking at my totaled car in front of me and realizing that, in that moment, I might have ceased to exist. Like I said earlier, I donâ€™t really believe in anything, so in my mind, that would have been the end of all things Iâ€™d experienced in my life. Every kiss or failed kiss or scrambler ride would come to a conclusion, andâ€¦ The officer comes over, and he says, â€œwhat happened?â€ And I said, â€œI got hit by this car, â€œand then I heard nothing, and then I heard the other car skid out and drive away.â€ The officer points over to the light. The other car has made a right turn at the light and veered into this very skinny tree. I canâ€™t help but think, â€œthatâ€™s karma. Thatâ€™s a hit and run and hit.â€ And then the officer puts this form in my face, and he goes, â€œsign this.â€ And I said, â€œwell, what does it mean?â€ And he goes, â€œit means youâ€™re okay and that we can leave.â€ I was really shaken up. I was like, â€œI donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m okay.â€ And he goes, â€œjust sign it,â€ which is a very unattractive quality. When someone just repeats a command that youâ€™ve just said no to, and itâ€™s unattractive, but very effective, you know. I signed it. Andy takes me to the hospital just as a precaution, but we have to wait two hours â€™cause the other driver had beat us there, andâ€¦ Eventually, weâ€™re with the doctor, and Andy says to him, he goes, â€œwell, was the other guy drunk?â€ And the doctor says, â€œwell, I canâ€™t answer that.â€ And Andy says, â€œwas he?â€ He uses the technique we had learned earlier, and it works, you know. The doctor says, â€œwell, heâ€™s heading to jail now.â€ And Andy and I flash each other a look like the hardy boys, like, â€œcase closed.â€ A few hours later, weâ€™re back at Andyâ€™s house, itâ€™s probably around 3:30 in the morning, and I have one of these epiphanies people sometimes have when they have near-death experiences. I say, â€œI need to call Jenny and tell her that we need to get married.â€ And Andy says, â€œMikeâ€¦ Sleep on it.â€ And I said, â€œno, no, no, this makes perfect sense.â€ And I pick up my phone, and I dial her number. And he puts his hand over the phone, and he says, â€œMikeâ€¦ Sleep on it.â€ He saves me.qX}  The next morning, I fly back to New York, and a few weeks later, I get a call from my rental car agency explaining that the accident report had come back on the accident that I just described. And it had found me at fault and that I owedâ€¦ And Iâ€™m not making this upâ€¦ $12,000 for the repairs on the other driverâ€™s Mercedes S.U.V. And I was like, â€œwell, this canâ€™t be happening.â€ I explained to the woman, â€œI think itâ€™s a misunderstanding. â€œThe other guy was clearly drunk. It was definitely not my fault.â€ And she said, â€œIâ€™m really sorry, but unless they change the accident report, you owe this money.â€ So I requested the accident report, and Iâ€™m gonna show you the actual accident report tonight. I donâ€™t know if youâ€™ve ever seen one of these things beforeâ€¦ But itâ€™s a little bit like homework for cops. And officer timson not so good with the homework. He consistently mixes up passenger one and passenger two, vehicle one and vehicle two. At one point, so badly that he says P-1â€¦ thatâ€™s meâ€¦ started to go, but all of a sudden V-1â€¦ Thatâ€™s me alsoâ€¦ Came at a high rate of speed, crashing into him. Now, Iâ€™m pretty self-destructive as a person, but I would never crash into my own car with my own car, nor would I understand how you could do that. This part is even crazier. The other driverâ€™s statement at the scene of the accident was, â€œI was on Venice goingâ€¦ uh, Iâ€™m not too sure. â€œI was going away from the beach. â€œI was driving. â€œI donâ€™t know what happened. â€œDid I hurt anyone? â€œI donâ€™t know where I was going, â€œbut I came from home. I had a sip of beer.â€ Which is really everyoneâ€™s favorite quantity of beer. Just the one sip, right? Thatâ€™s what they serve these days at the home/beach/pub.
So all of itâ€™s mine. The officer makes one key mistake. He checks the box that finds me at fault. So Iâ€™m like, â€œI need to get officer Timson on the phone, so we can clear up this misunderstanding.â€ The problem is he keeps ducking my calls, and I know â€™cause Iâ€™m calling two or three times a day, leaving messages, calling departments next to his department, so he knows Iâ€™m trying to reach him. And finally, after a month of this, I get him on the phone, and Iâ€™m so relieved. And I explain this misunderstanding. And he listens to me, and he says, â€œdo the right thing, and pay for the guyâ€™s car.â€ I know, and, I mean, thatâ€™s what I said. I go, â€œarenâ€™t you listening to any of this?â€ I go, â€œand this guy was clearly drunk. â€œI mean, he nearly killed me. â€œInches from where he hit, â€œand I would be dead right now. â€œAnd he wants me to pay for his car? â€œDonâ€™t you see how crazy that is, just as one human being to another?â€ And he says, â€œdo the right thing, and pay for the guyâ€™s car.â€ And he hangs up the phone. And at this point, this stops being about money, and itâ€™s just about stopping a man who has no regard for people or the law. This is Chinatown! So I started printing up Google maps of the scene of the accident and California state driving law. Iâ€™m on the phone with lawyers and private investigators. Thereâ€™s only one lawyer who would consider the case. And he was an accident lawyer, and he said, â€œdid you have any loss of income from the accident?â€ And I said, â€œno,â€ and he says, â€œdid you have any loss of income from the accident?â€ And I said, â€œno. This isnâ€™t about money.â€ And he doesnâ€™t take the case, and this is when I start going completely mad.
Iâ€™m up to about 4:00 or 5:00 A.M. every night just surfing the web. I get a subscription to a site called netdetective.com, which is a great site for vigilantes who have $29.95. So now I know this guyâ€™s name, I know where he lives, I know what he does for a living. And in my mind, it becomes like a trailer for a revenge thriller. Like, â€œJim Bosworth thought he was gonna get away with this, â€œbut Jim Bosworth had another thing coming: Mike Birbiglia.â€ I was like, â€œIâ€™m gonna track down Jim Bosworth. â€œIâ€™m gonna sue Jim Bosworth, and Iâ€™m gonna sue the entire Los Angeles police department!â€ At this point, people stopped talking to me entirely. My friends would call me like, â€œhey, whatâ€™s going on?â€ Iâ€™d be like, â€œIâ€™ll tell you whatâ€™s going on!â€ Iâ€™d tell them this whole story. And theyâ€™d be like, â€œyou should get a lawyer.â€ Iâ€™d be like, â€œthis is way past lawyers! A lawyer wouldnâ€™t even touch this!â€ â€˜Cause he wouldnâ€™t.
The only person who would talk to me at this point was Jenny. One night, we were out to dinner at a restaurant, and sheâ€™s talking to me, but Iâ€™m not listening â€™cause Iâ€™m writing down ideas I have for the case on my napkin. Iâ€™ve drawn out a diagram of the intersection, and the angles the cars are coming from and going to and the lanes that we were in, the laws the other driver broke, and the phone numbers Iâ€™m gonna call that week. And Iâ€™m so angry, Iâ€™m writing over my own handwriting to the point where Iâ€™m ripping through the napkin. And Jenny looks at me, and she says, â€œwhat are you doing?â€ And I said, â€œwell, this is my case.â€ And she says, â€œwell, why donâ€™t you work on that in the morning?â€ And I said, â€œwell, which part of this napkin donâ€™t you understand?â€ Jenny says, â€œMikeâ€¦ â€œYouâ€™re right, â€œbut itâ€™s only hurting you, â€œand Iâ€™m just so glad that youâ€™re alive, and I think that we should focus on that.â€ She only has to say it once, and I give up the case, and I pay for this guyâ€™s car. July 7, 2007, Jenny and I went to city hall and got married. I still didnâ€™t believe in the idea of marriage, and I still donâ€™t. But I believe in her, and Iâ€™ve given up on the idea of being right.qXk   Thank you guys very much. Thank you. Thank you guys so much! Thanks for coming here tonight and joining me.qe.
