Fade the music out. Letâ€™s roll. Hold there. Lights. Do the lights. Thank you. Thank you very much. I appreciate that. I donâ€™t necessarily agree with you, but I appreciate very much. Well, this is a nice place. This is easily the nicest place For many miles in every direction. Thatâ€™s how you compliment a building And shit on a town with one sentence. It is odd around here, as I was driving here. There doesnâ€™t seem to be any difference Between the sidewalk and the street for pedestrians here. People just kind of walk in the middle of the road. I love traveling And seeing all the different parts of the country. I live in New York. I live in aâ€“ Thereâ€™s no value to your doing that at all.qXö  â€œThe Old Lady And The Dogâ€
I liveâ€“ I live in New York. I alwaysâ€“ Like, thereâ€™s this old lady in my neighborhood, And sheâ€™s always walking her dog. Sheâ€™s always justâ€“ sheâ€™s very old. She just stands there just being old, And the dog just fights gravity every day, justâ€“ The two of them, itâ€™s reallyâ€“ The dogâ€™s got a cloudy eye, and sheâ€™s got a cloudy eye, And they just stand there looking at the street In two dimensions together, andâ€“ And sheâ€™s always wearing, like, this old sweater dress. I guess it was a sweater when she was, like, 5â€™10â€, But now itâ€™s just, like, this sweater And her legs areâ€“ her legs are a nightmare. Theyâ€™re just white with green streaks and bones sticking out. Her legs are awful. I saw a guy with no legs wheeling by, And he was like, â€œyecch, no thank you. â€œI do not want those. â€œIâ€™d rather just have air down here like I have Than to look down at that shit.â€ I see these two all the time, and I always look at them, And I always think, â€œgod, I hope she dies first.â€ I do. I hope she dies first, for her sake, Because I donâ€™t want her to lose the dog. I donâ€™t think sheâ€™ll be able to handle it. If she diesâ€“ If the old lady dies first, Iâ€™m not worried about the dog Because the dog doesnâ€™t even know about the old lady. This dog is aware of three inches around his head. Heâ€™s living in two-second increments. The second heâ€™s in and the one he just left Is all he knows about, But if he dies, this lady, sheâ€™s gonna be destroyed Because this dog is all she has, And I know heâ€™s all she has because she has him. Thereâ€™s noâ€“ If she had one person in her life, She would not keep this piece of shit little dog. Even if just some young woman in her building one morning Were to say, â€œgood morning, gladys,â€ Sheâ€™d be like, â€œgood,â€ And just flush him down the toilet, justâ€“ Poom! Poom! The dog just keeps bumping on the drain. Poom! â€œâ€ she gives up. Ends up just shitting on her dog for the rest of her life. P-p-p! Poom!qX÷  â€œMy Daughter Likes Fishâ€
You ever flush a pet down the toilet? I had to flush my daughterâ€™s fish down the toilet. I came home, the fish was dead. She wasnâ€™t home from school yet, so I just flushed the fish, And thatâ€™s a weird moment, too, â€™cause fish live in water. So you put it in the toilet, floats to the bottom, Like, â€œyeah, heâ€™s dead,â€ And then you flush, and it looks like he goes, â€œwait a second! Aw, shit! â€œI was taking a nap! Jesus! â€œyou gotta be in constant motion To get any respect in this house.â€ And then my daughter comes home. â€œwhy did he die, daâ€“â€ Come on. What am I gonna say? Why did he die? Because who gives a shit? Thatâ€™s the reason. Thatâ€™s the actual reason, is because didnâ€™t matter That he was alive. Thatâ€™s why heâ€™s dead. He didnâ€™t know his name, and he didnâ€™t love you back. These are the facts about that fishâ€™s life. My daughter likes fish. We took her to the aquarium. I took both my kids to the aquarium in boston, And we were looking at this seal, or sea lion. I donâ€™t know which one. I donâ€™t care. I donâ€™t think they need to be separate things. I really donâ€™t. They donâ€™t care, and we donâ€™t care. Thereâ€™s, like, three scientists Who give a shit what we call all those things. The scientists could go on TV tomorrow And say, â€œok, everybody. â€œfrom now on, seals and sea lions and walruses, Andâ€“you know what?â€“Penguins are all seals now,â€ And we would all be like, â€œyeah, all right. Fine. Yes. Whatever, man.â€ Anyway, so weâ€™re looking at this seal/sea lion thing, And heâ€™s looking back at us through the plexiglas, And heâ€™s goingâ€“ Theyâ€™re really disgusting in person. Most animals are when you really see them. You ever go to a farm? You think youâ€™re gonna see little, white sheep Going, â€œbaa,â€ but theyâ€™re all fat and shit-colored, And theyâ€™re likeâ€“ Jesus. That thing is awful. Anyway, seals donâ€™t goâ€“ They goâ€“ My daughterâ€™s like, â€œwhat is he saying?â€ I donâ€™t know! â€œIâ€™m a slave! Kill me!â€qX	
  â€œThe Food Chainâ€
Must be awful to be other kinds of stuff, You know? Iâ€™m glad Iâ€™m this. This is a pretty good deal when you consider the alternatives. Anything else, any other kind of thing, youâ€™re in the food chain. Youâ€™re in the foodâ€“ we are out of the food chain. I donâ€™t know if we fully appreciate the fact That we got out of the food chain. That is a massive upgrade Because for every other living thing, Life ends by being eaten. Thatâ€™s how all life ends, isâ€“ Every single life except human life, Every life ends like this. Aah! Aah! Aah! Weâ€™re the only ones that get to just die old in a bed, Just â€œI love you. Bye.â€ I mean, imagine if we were still in the food chain On top of everything else. Imagine if we were in the food chain. It would just be another thing you gotta deal with. Youâ€™re already having a bad day. You wake in up in the morning. Youâ€™re making breakfast. You burn your toast, and itâ€™s too late to try again, And your kid comes in and says, â€œbeh,â€ and youâ€™re like, â€œfine,â€ And itâ€™s just, â€œwhy?â€ You get a thing in the mail That says that your phoneâ€™s different, And your mortgage is another company now. What? I donâ€™t get it! Then youâ€™re walking to work like, â€œwhy do I even bother? â€œshit! Goddamn it! â€œthereâ€™s always fucking cheetahs at the train station! Stop it!â€ You think that sharksâ€“ Do you think that sharks would be embarrassed If they knew that we could all see their fins Sticking out the top of the water? I think theyâ€™d be bummed â€™cause I donâ€™t think sharks are aware of that at all. I think sharks think theyâ€™re slick. They swim around like, â€œhey, nobody has any idea whatâ€™s down here,â€ And weâ€™re all up here like, â€œthereâ€™s totally a shark right there.â€ It wouldnâ€™t be fun being a predator, either. If youâ€™re a predator, imagine if every time youâ€™re hungry, You gotta chase a guy Whoâ€™s running for his life. You gottaâ€“ â€œcome on, dude! Shit, get over here!â€ And just hold him down and bite his neck Till he shuts the fuck up for a minute So you can just sit there and eat his stomach Before you go to work. That would really suck. Thatâ€™s why animals justâ€“ They go, â€œletâ€™s do this together, man. â€œyou chase the parents away. I am gonna eat the kid, and you circle back.â€ Thatâ€™s why they do it like that. â€œfuck it. Iâ€™m eating babies. This is bullshit.â€ â€œgrownups ainâ€™t worth the meat.â€ Whoops, all right. All right. shit. Goddamn it. Idiot. This isnâ€™t a gay voice, by the way. Itâ€™s not. Shut up. yeah.qXp  â€œCourtyard Confrontationâ€
I live in New York city, and itâ€™s OK there. I live in a nice building. I never lived in a nice place before. When I was growing up, I had no money. I mean, my mom didnâ€™t. Didnâ€™t matter. I was a child. But Iâ€™m not used to it â€™cause itâ€™s nice. Thereâ€™s, like, a pretty courtyard With flowers and a fountain with little marble boys pissing. I donâ€™t know. What is it with fountains? Like, all fountain sculptors are pedophiles, basically. You canâ€™t get a fountain made withoutâ€“ â€œcan you make me a fountain?â€ â€œyes, Iâ€™ll get started right away! â€œYes! Yes! Itâ€™s finished!â€ And itâ€™s just little boys pissing on the face Of a Greek god that looks like him a lot. â€œjust piss on me forever!â€ Anyway, thereâ€™s one of those in the courtyard of my building, And my first week in the building about a year ago, I went down to the courtyard for the first time, And I didnâ€™t look too good, you know? It was a Sunday morning. Thatâ€™s my least presentable hour. Thereâ€™s a lot of, you know, just stains, Just like, you know, food and me and whateverâ€¦ And so Iâ€™m sitting there. So? Shut up. Ha ha ha! Anyway, but so there I was. Iâ€™m sitting on the stone bench of this courtyard And feeling a little out of place. You know, thereâ€™s these fancy doormen and stuff, And then thereâ€™s this guy looking at me. I notice heâ€™s looking at me from across the courtyard, And heâ€™s all spiffy-looking. Heâ€™s got brown shoes, and heâ€™s looking at me like, â€œâ€ I can tell he was thinking I donâ€™t live in the building. He thinks I just wandered in off the streets And sat in the courtyard. I can tell heâ€™s thinking of coming over And dealing with me on his own, and Iâ€™m sitting there thinking, Like, â€œplease do that. Yes. Please, come on, come on. Come on, come on, come on,â€ And Iâ€™m trying to look even more gross, And Iâ€™m, like, pulling up my shirt, â€œâ€ And then I see him go, â€œno. Thatâ€™s not gonna do at all,â€ And he comes over to me, â€œâ€ and Iâ€™m like, â€œNum num num!â€ Iâ€™m so excited to have this thing, a confrontation Where Iâ€™m not wrong at all and he thinks I am. â€œrrgh!â€ So he comes over, says, â€œexcuse me, â€œdo you live in this building?â€ And I said, â€œno,â€ â€™cause why not start there? I said, â€œno.â€ He goes, â€œwell then, what are you doing here?â€ And I said, â€œI just need to rest. Iâ€™m having a hard time.â€ He says, â€œthis is private property,â€ And I said, â€œwell, I donâ€™t really believe in that.â€ You know, just the worst things I could say from his point of view is basically all the things I was saying, And he goes, â€œwell, if you donâ€™t leave, Iâ€™m gonna talk to the doorman.â€ I was like, â€œcan I just stay, like, five more hours?â€ So heâ€™sâ€“â€œno,â€ and he goes over to the doorman and I see him talking about me to the doorman like this, and then I see the doorman going, â€œno. That guy lives here. Itâ€™s OK,â€ And the look on his faceâ€“ mwah mwah! Num num!â€“ It was just soâ€“ It was this beautiful cocktail of anger and confusion. Itâ€™s like I had invented a new way to hurt somebodyâ€™s feelings. Thatâ€™s how excited I was.qX|  â€œGetting What â€˜Oldâ€™ Isâ€
Iâ€™m 45 now, So Iâ€™m either halfway through a healthy life or almost done with a not-so-healthy life. I donâ€™t know which one. I wonâ€™t know till itâ€™s over where this was. I donâ€™t know how long Iâ€™m gonna live. I donâ€™t know. Nobody knows, I guess. I think human life expectancy is pretty good. We get a good run, you know? Some people die early, you know? If I die now, people will be like, â€œthatâ€™s too bad.â€ If I die five years from now, theyâ€™ll be like, â€œwell, all right,â€ like itâ€™s not evenâ€“ Itâ€™sâ€“ Like, as soon as youâ€™re 50, youâ€™re a candidate. You know, thereâ€™s no candlelight vigils for 50-year-old guys that die, and you start pushingâ€“ You know, some people get to be like, 80s, 90s. You know, there are people that get to, like, 114, and then theyâ€™re in the news, and itâ€™s always some old guy, â€œI met Napoleon.â€ No, you didnâ€™t, you liar, You oldest liar in the world. But 45, you know, youâ€™re not old yet, But you start having moments Where you kind of start getting what old is, Especially if you didnâ€™t take care of yourself, you know? I have moments where Iâ€™m like, â€œwow, this seems early for this.â€ Like, this is something that happens to me a lot. Iâ€™ll be sitting watching TV or doing nothing, And all of a sudden, Iâ€™ll realize, â€œI need to wipe my ass right now.â€ â€œI mean, nothing happened, But I really gotta wipe my ass right now. Right now.â€ Gotta make trips to the bathroom just to wipe my ass. How does this happen already? Iâ€™m 45. Already, my assholeâ€™s just like, â€œJustâ€“ â€ My assholeâ€“ My assholeâ€™s like the waistband on old pajama bottoms, Just kindaâ€¦ Loose and ineffectual. My assholeâ€™s like a bag of leaves that nobody tied up. Itâ€™s just sitting on the lawn, full and open, Puking leaves onto the grass with every wisp of wind. Some kid kicks it over on his way home From a tough day at middle school. â€œrats.â€ Thatâ€™s a pretty accurate description of my asshole. Hereâ€™s another thing about my age right now. If Iâ€™mâ€“ OK. Say Iâ€™m sitting down. If Iâ€™m sitting anywhere, whichâ€“ha ha ha!â€“ I love sitting so muchâ€“ I would take sitting and doing nothing To standing and fucking any day. This is way better than coming. This is way better. This is whatâ€“ At my age, if Iâ€™m sitting down and somebody tells me I need to get up and go to another room, I need to be told all the information why first. You gotta explain all that shit to me. â€œwhat? Why do Iâ€“ no. Why, though?â€ â€œYour car is being towed right now!â€ â€œWell, thatâ€™s what happens to me, then. Thatâ€™sâ€“ I accept that.â€ â€™cause getting up is a whole thing. It means first, I have to decide, â€œdo I really want to be alive anymore?â€ Like, letâ€™s start with that, And then I gotta, â€œâ€ start kind of rocking to get momentum, â€œâ€ like Iâ€™m trying to get an old Honda out of a snow bank. â€œshit.â€qX~  â€œPutting On Socksâ€
The worst part of my day, worst part of every day of my life, is when I have to put on my socks. Putting on my socks is the worst part of every day, and it always will be. Even if I have a terrible day in the future Where my grandmother is murdered by my other grandmother, If that ever happened to me, the worst part of that day Will be when I put on my socks becauseâ€“ Putting on my socks, that means I have toâ€“ Hereâ€™s what I have to do. I have to get my hands past my pointed toe. I donâ€™t even know how I do it. Iâ€™m sitting here. I donâ€™t know how I do that. Itâ€™s â€™cause you have toâ€“ Itâ€™s like folding a bowling ball in half. Soon as I start, I can feelâ€“ Iâ€™m pushing all the fat up into my vital organs, And I just feel all the systems failing. â€œbeep, beep, beep!â€ And I have to, like, lay on my back like an eight-year-old And go like this, and I start passing out. And I know other peopleâ€™s lives are hard. Ha ha ha! I know. I saw an interview on TV with Michael J. Fox, And he has Parkinsonâ€™s, and he was describing brushing his teeth, and he said It takes him two hours a day, and he said itâ€™s agony, And I saw this and I thought, â€œOK. Thatâ€™s hard.â€ That is hard, And so is putting on my socks. Sorry, Michael. Doesnâ€™t make it easier to know about your thing. Tell you what. Iâ€™ll help you brush your teeth, you help me with the socks.qXÅ
  â€œIf Youâ€™re Older Youâ€™re Smarterâ€
I donâ€™t know. I like getting older, though. Life is an education, and if youâ€™re older, youâ€™re smarter. I just believe that. If youâ€™re in an argument with somebody And theyâ€™re older than you, you should listen to them. It doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™re right. It means that even if theyâ€™re wrong, Their wrongness is rooted in more information than you have. Theyâ€™ve been there longer. If youâ€™re older, youâ€™re smarter. How many people here, by applause, are 45 or older? 45 or older, applaud. OK. Thatâ€™s about 60 people out of 2,400. Hereâ€™s the interesting thing. Thereâ€™s way more. I can see you. Thereâ€™s so many more. This is Arizona. There are way more people in that demographic, But they didnâ€™t clap. Why? â€™cause theyâ€™re smart. Theyâ€™re sitting in the dark going, â€œI donâ€™t have to clap. I donâ€™t have to do anything.â€ Theyâ€™re not doing it, and theyâ€™re right. You know why? â€™cause never identify yourself. Never. Are you crazy? You donâ€™t know why Iâ€™m asking. How do you know whatâ€“ OK. Burn them all. Burn everybody over 45. How do you know Iâ€™m not gonna do that? How many people here, by applause, are 40 or younger? 40 or younger, applaud. Thatâ€™s every time. â€œWhoo! Whoo!â€ every time. That is a weird thing to celebrate in a room where youâ€™re not the only people here. Thatâ€™s like going to a cancer wardâ€“ â€œnot me! Whoo! I donâ€™t have it! I donâ€™t have it!â€ If youâ€™re older, youâ€™re smarter. A 55-year-old garbage man is a million times smarter than a 28-year-old with three ph.D.S, Especially smarter than him, â€™cause this idiot Has been thinking about three things for, like, 15 years. Heâ€™s worthless. The garbage man is 55. Heâ€™s had some experience. Things have happened to him. He went to cape cod one summer. He saw a dead guy floating in the motel pool. He took a bus to Montreal. He got a hand job at a fairâ€¦ From a miner. I mean a miner. Not a minor, a miner. You understand? A miner. A grown man who works in a mine With dirty hands jacked him off at a county fair. Thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m saying happened to the 55-year-old. You see? Heâ€™s had some experience. He knows more. More has happened to him. Heâ€™s seen more. Heâ€™s seen history. Heâ€™s witnessed history, Even if itâ€™s not ancient history. He saw Nixon resign on live television. Me and those few people that clapped, We saw the president of America cry And then quit being the president. That shit was crazy â€™cause none of us knew what was gonna happen next. Today people are like, â€œthe presidentâ€™s kind of disappointing.â€ Really? Our president wept like an insane person And then got on a helicopter and flew awayâ€¦ And the whole nation just watched him go.qX-  â€œGetting Older Makes My Life Betterâ€
I like getting older, though, because for me, The kind of guy I am, getting older Makes my life better, you know, Like, my sex life, way better at 45, Look, â€™cause this situation is OK at 45. This is not a fun kind of a 17-year-old to be. And some people, their life is better when theyâ€™re younger. You know, young dudes, young, skinny dudes, Best life in the world is being a young, skinny dude. They donâ€™t have to do anything. They just show up With a big adamâ€™s apple and a smelly t-shirt. â€œhey, Iâ€™m here for the easy pussy for the rest of my life.â€ â€œso where do Iâ€“ everywhere? OK. Cool.â€ But for guys like me, this is not a fun youth. It gets better. Iâ€™d like to make one of those â€œit gets betterâ€ ads For just dumpy, young guys. We could use a little help, a little encouragement, Just somebody on TV, â€œlisten, man. â€œI know itâ€™s tough right now. â€œYouâ€™re vaguely heavy with no face. â€œYou have zero value on the sexual marketplace. â€œYou feel invisible to the girls in school because you are, â€œbut it gets better because youâ€™ll all grow up, â€œand you pretty much look just like this your whole life, â€œand they donâ€™t. â€œTheir options start running out really fast, â€œand youâ€™re gonna be there. â€œAs long as you stay relatively employed and washed, â€œyouâ€™re gonna be amazing in your 40s. â€œYouâ€™re gonna beâ€“ â€œyouâ€™re gonna be the branch that she can grab â€œbefore she hits the ground. â€œItâ€™s gonna be so great. â€œIt just takes time for her circumstances â€œto match your looks, but itâ€™s gonna happen. â€œItâ€™s gonna happen. â€œWhen real shit matters, youâ€™re gonna be the sexiest motherfucker in the world.â€ Itâ€™s just time. Thatâ€™s all it takes. Thereâ€™s a formula to this. Itâ€™s pussy plus time over income squared.q	X1  â€œEverybody Has Their Timeâ€
Everybody has their time. Everybody has their time. I mean, not everybody. There are people out there who thereâ€™s just nobody for them. Yep. People like to say things like, â€œthereâ€™s someone for everyone.â€ Nope! Not at all true, and stop saying it â€™cause itâ€™s mean to people who never find anybody. There are millions of people out there who weâ€™ve all unanimously decided, they are light speed ugly and nobody kisses them on the lips, even. Nobody touches their genitals their entire life. They just wash it, and then they die. Thatâ€™s all that happens, â€œaww,â€ and if youâ€™re feeling bad for them, you can go find one and fuck one tomorrow, you can just solve the problem right there with all that kindness in your heart. â€œAww.â€ Well, go fuck one. â€œNah.â€ I didnâ€™t think so. Thatâ€™s the one way weâ€™re all mean. Nobody does that. Nobody fucks down, nobody. People fuck up or across. Some women fuck down because a guy talked them into that it was up. Some guy, â€œyeah. No. You should. Iâ€™m totally up. Yeah.â€q
X$	  â€œDating Takes Courageâ€
Itâ€™s a weird selection process that we have. Dating really isâ€“ Itâ€™s how we evolve, is dating. Itâ€™s how we choose each other, And dating is a real drag for a lot of people, But I always think itâ€™s a nice thing. You know, when I see a date, Iâ€™m always happy when I see a couple on a date â€™cause it means people are still trying, you know? You see a couple on a date, It means thereâ€™s still courage out there. That takes courage, to go on a date, for both sides, Two very different kinds of courage. The male courage, traditionally speaking, is that he decided to ask. He went up to a random woman who he has no idea If sheâ€™s gonna like him or not and he walked up to her terrified. Everything in your body is telling you, â€œjust go the fuck home and jerk off. Donâ€™t do this!â€ But he walked up and said, â€œhi. Yes,â€ And sheâ€™s like, â€œâ€ â€œno, no, no. A second. Give me a second,â€ And you try to get through this membrane of, you knowâ€“ And then, if it works And you say, â€œyou wanna go out sometime?â€ Sometimes sheâ€™ll say yes, and if she says yes, thatâ€™s her courage, and the courage it takes for a woman to say yes is beyond anything I can imagine. A woman saying yes to a date with a man is literally insane and ill-advised, and the whole speciesâ€™ existence counts on them doing it, and I donâ€™t know how theyâ€“ How do women still go out with guys when you consider the fact that there is no greater threat to women than men? Weâ€™re the number-one threat to women. Globally and historically, weâ€™re the number-one cause of injury and mayhem to women. Weâ€™re the worst thing that ever happens to them. Thatâ€™s true. You know what our number-one threat is? Heart disease. Thatâ€™s the whole thing. Thatâ€™s it, just our own heart going, â€œdude, I canâ€™tâ€“ â€œyou canâ€™t keep doing this. I told you three strokes ago that this is not smart,â€ But women stillâ€“ â€œyeah. Iâ€™ll go out with you alone at night.â€ What are you, nuts? â€œIâ€™ll get in your car with you with my little shoulders. Hi. Where are we going?â€ â€œTo your death, statistically.â€ How do they still do it? If youâ€™re a guy, try to imagine that you could only date a half-bear, half-lion, And youâ€™re like, â€œI hope this oneâ€™s nice. I hope he doesnâ€™t do what heâ€™s going to do.â€qX—  â€œFirst Dateâ€
I alwaysâ€“ I love when I see a date. You know, when you see a date, you can tell itâ€™s the first date â€™cause of the way theyâ€™re walking together And sheâ€™s looking up at his face trying to figure him out, And heâ€™s just a mess. A guy on a first date just has no actual personality. Heâ€™s just a mishmash of different kinds of dudes for a couple of seconds each, just anything, no cohesiveâ€“ Just like a ransom note cut out of a lot of magazines, just, you know, â€œwellâ€¦ â€œha ha! â€œwell, yes. I think so, too. Ha ha! Rrghâ€¦â€ Whatever, just like a blind dick in space just thrusting in infinite directions Hoping to find pay dirt at someplace, And then sometimes you see a date thatâ€™s later down the line and something has happened. Thereâ€™s something that happens in a date that I never get to witness â€™cause women do this. They get to do it inside. They get to just decide quietly, â€œIâ€™m gonna let him fuck me.â€ They just get to decide. Something he says, and sheâ€™s like, â€œthat was good. Heâ€™s gonna fuck me later,â€ And he has no idea. Heâ€™s still, like, trying all this shit. He still has no idea heâ€™s already in there.qX}  â€œTitsâ€
Guys areâ€“ We love women a lotâ€“ all men doâ€“ And we just look at you. Thatâ€™s what I do. I just look at women. I justâ€“â€œâ€ Like theyâ€™re, you know, cakes in windows. I justâ€“â€œâ€ I was walking in New York once, and thereâ€™s these two very cute women walking behind me, and I was trying to walk slowly so I could hear what they were saying to each other, you know, â€™cause they were cute, so I wanted to hear them, like thatâ€™s gonna help me in any way, to hear theirâ€“ â€œdonâ€™t you wish the guy walking in front of us would squeeze our tits for, like, one second?â€ OK. Here. Here I go. Thank you. Itâ€™s really a flaw in men that we would all do that. If youâ€™re a woman, you could ask any guy on planet earth, â€œcould you squeeze my tit for one second?â€ And 100% of us will go, â€œyes, of course.â€ That doesnâ€™t matter. I could be doing open heart surgery. â€œyeah. Ok.â€ Beep! â€œdonâ€™t worry. Heâ€™s not your tits. Donâ€™t worry about it.â€ I donâ€™t know why we love tits so much. Some people say itâ€™s because we breastfeed, but so do women, Or, you know, baby women. Not grown-up women, donâ€™t usuallyâ€“ You donâ€™t see, like, a 68-year-old woman, Like, a stately lookâ€“ You know, like Sigourney weaver, Like, sucking milk out of a young womanâ€™s tit. â€œthank you, Deborah. Iâ€™ll see you tomorrow at 2:00.â€ Itâ€™s not usually the thing, Is the elderly breastfeeding from the young, Except for at the end of â€œthe grapes of wrath,â€ Which I donâ€™t mean to ruin that book for you, But you should have read it by now. I donâ€™t know if you read â€œthe grapes of wrath,â€ But thatâ€™s how it ends, with an old, dying man Sucking milk out of a young girlâ€™s tits, And then the book is over, and youâ€™re like, â€œJesus! What happened at the end there? Thatâ€™s crazy.â€ Thereâ€™s no other book in that genre. Thereâ€™s no dense, historic classic That ends with a weird, porny paragraph at the veryâ€“ â€œand then Anna Karenina shat on his chest.â€ â€œholy moly with that!â€ â€œthe end.â€ â€œmy god! â€œthat is a violent shift in tone at the end of that book. Iâ€™ve been reading this book for three months.â€ But we do, we love tits, And you always know a tit. You always know a tit. You know, like you ever been in a crowded placeâ€“ Like a subway or like, you know, a sports stadiumâ€“ And youâ€™re smooshed in with other people And your elbow touches a tit behind you, youâ€™re like, â€œthatâ€™s a tit. I just touched it. I know that was a tit. I know it!â€ Because the sensitivity of the male elbow To tit flesh specifically is unbelievable, just to tits, â€™cause you could drive a tack in there, Iâ€™m not gonna feel it, But a titâ€“ Through a shirt and a sweater and a jacket And her jacket, sweater, shirt and bra, somehowâ€¦ â€œitâ€™s a tit! I touched a tit! â€œI touched a tit! I touched one tit. One tit.â€ Thatâ€™s rare, to touch one tit. Itâ€™s like a four-leaf clover. Usually, you touch two. The only time you touch one tit is when it was an accident Or you didnâ€™t have permission, But otherwiseâ€¦ When tit access is granted, Itâ€™s usually good for two tits at a time. Itâ€™s, once youâ€™re on oneâ€“ You really have to screw up really badly and quickly To lose tit access between tits one and two. You must have said something really dumb on the first tit That you didnâ€™t get the second one. â€œyeah, itâ€™s like your momâ€™s dirty whore tit.â€ â€œwhy? What? I said I liked it. â€œthatâ€™s what I meant, is that I like it. â€œI like your momâ€™s dirty whore tit, And I like yours,â€ And if itâ€™s up to the guy, weâ€™re gonna touch both tits. No guy touches a tit and then goes, â€œyou know what? â€œIâ€™m good with the one. Thatâ€™s fine for me. Everything in moderation.â€ Weâ€™re gonna touch both, Even if something terrible happens in the middle ofâ€“ â€œyeahâ€“â€ â€œthereâ€™s a bomb!â€ â€œshit! Come on, letâ€™s getâ€“ â€œcome on! Letâ€™s get your tits out of here!â€qXl  â€œDivorceâ€
Iâ€™ve seen a few tits. Iâ€™ve seenâ€“I donâ€™t knowâ€“ 48 maybe. I donâ€™t know. I had my history in my life, you know? Iâ€™ve been divorced for five years, And itâ€™s been the best part of my life, being divorced, Easily my favorite part of my life. I love being divorced. Every year has been better than the last. That is the only time I can say that about, and by the way, Iâ€™m not saying donâ€™t get married. If you meet somebody, fall in love and get married, And then get divorced because thatâ€™s the best part. Itâ€™s the best part. Marriage is just like a larva stage for true happiness, Which is divorce, Because you just let go and everythingâ€™s fine now. Divorce is forever. It really actually is. Marriage is for how long you can hack it, But divorce just gets stronger like a piece of oak. Nobody ever says, â€ my divorce is falling apart. Itâ€™s over. I canâ€™t take it.â€ And again, if youâ€™re in a good marriage, stay in it. If youâ€™re in the best marriage ever, stay in it. Iâ€™m just saying, if you got out, it would be better. Thatâ€™s just a fact. Iâ€™m sorry. Iâ€™m sorry, but itâ€™s true. Everythingâ€™s better. My ex-wife and I, This is the best part of our knowing each other. Weâ€™re good co-parents because we live apart and weâ€™re friends. Our kids go to her half the week, They come to me half the week, and Iâ€™m a good father. Iâ€™m an attentive, focused, and responsible father. Do you know why? â€˜Cause I get to say good-bye to these kids every week. Are you shitting me? Itâ€™s like every parentâ€™s fantasy. Who canâ€™t be a good father for half of every week? No matter how bad it gets, every Wednesday, I get to go, â€œgood-bye, girls. â€œDaddyâ€™s gonna go upstairs and pour whiskey all over his naked body right now.â€ â€œIâ€™m gonna lay in my own filth until two seconds before you come back here.â€ Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m such a good dad.qX]  â€œVideoing Your Kidsâ€
My daughter was having a dance thing at her school. They had this big dance. Anyway, we all went, all the parents, And everybodyâ€™s there, and everybodyâ€™s got their phone, Every single parent. It was an amazing thing to watch â€™cause kids are dancing And every parent is standing there like this. Every single person was blocking their vision Of their actual child with their phone, and the kidsâ€“ I went over by the stage and the kidsâ€“ Thereâ€™s people holding iPads in front of their faces. It looked like weâ€™re all in the witness protection program. Like, the kids canâ€™t see their parents, And everybodyâ€™s watching a shitty movie Of something thatâ€™s happening ten feetâ€“ Like, look at your fucking kid. The resolution on the kid is unbelievable if you just look. Itâ€™s totally HD. Why are you taping this? Youâ€™re never gonna watch it. In a million years, youâ€™re not gonna watch videos Of your kids doing shit you missed The first time it happened. You donâ€™t watch it. You just put it on Facebook. â€œhere, you watch it. I wanna take a nap now.â€ And then you get to read all the comments. â€œmy god! â€œitâ€™s so cute! Ngaah!â€ And guess what? Theyâ€™re not watching it, either. Theyâ€™re not watching the video. These kids are dancing for no one. Nobody watches the videos on your Facebook. They see the first frame of a kid and they go, â€œthatâ€™s very nice. OK. Back to this.â€ Nobodyâ€™s watching your kidsâ€™ videos on Facebook, I promise you. Iâ€™ll prove it to you. Next time you tape your kidâ€™s dance, Tape one second of it and then add 20 minutes of just your own asshole. Just go in the bathroom and just record your own anus opening and closing for 20 minutes. Tack it onto your kid dancing for a second. Put that on Facebook. Everybody will write the same thing. â€œThatâ€™s adorable! I think I see a future star!â€qXQ  â€œLife Is A Good Dealâ€
Donâ€™t tape shit on yourâ€“ Life is short. Life is very short. I like life. I like it. I feel like even if it ends up being short, I got lucky to have it â€™cause life is an amazing gift When you think about what you get with a basic life, Not even a particularly lucky life or a healthy life. If you have a life, thatâ€™s an amaâ€“ Hereâ€™s your boilerplate deal with life. This is basic cable, what you get when you get life. You get to be on earth. First of allâ€“my godâ€“ what a location. This is earth, and for trillions of miles in every direction, It fucking sucks so bad. Itâ€™s so shitty that your eyes bolt out of your head â€™cause it sucks so bad. You get to be on earth and look at shit, As long as youâ€™re not blind or whatever it is. You get to be here. You get to eat food. You get to put bacon in your mouth. I mean, when you have bacon in your mouth, It doesnâ€™t matter whoâ€™s president or anything, You justâ€“â€œâ€ Every time Iâ€™m eating bacon, I think, â€œI could die right now,â€ and I mean it! Thatâ€™s how good life is. You get toâ€“ you get to fuck. Thatâ€™s free if youâ€™re smart. That comes with. Thatâ€™s part of the deal. Where else are you gonna get that deal? You get to put your dick in there and go in and out, Pretty good, And if youâ€™re a woman, you get to just lay back And just have a dick just shoving in and out of you awkwardly Anytime you want, anytime you want. If youâ€™re a gay man, you get to just fill your boyfriendâ€™s ass with your dick, just fill it all the way to the balls, And itâ€™s nice and warm and tight in there, And heâ€™s your buddy. If youâ€™re a lesbian, You get to do all the stuff theyâ€™re doing, andâ€¦ Itâ€™s a great deal. You get to eat. You get to fuck. You get to read â€œto kill a mockingbird.â€ Itâ€™s a great life. So, you know, Iâ€™m not worried about it ending.qXã  â€œBehind The Wheelâ€
Itâ€™s pretty good, and Iâ€™ve wasted a lot of time Just being angry at people I donâ€™t know. You know, itâ€™s amazing how nasty we can get as people, Depending on the situation. Like, most people are OK as long as theyâ€™re OK, But if you put people in certain contexts, they just change. Like, when Iâ€™m in my car, I have a different set of values. I am the worst person I can be when Iâ€™m behind the wheel, which is when Iâ€™m at my most dangerous. When youâ€™re driving, Thatâ€™s when you need to be the most compassionate And responsible of any other time in your life â€™cause you are fucking driving a weapon amongst weapons, and yet itâ€™s the worst people get, and I am the worst. One time, I was driving, and there was a guy ahead of me, And he kind ofâ€“I donâ€™t knowâ€“ sorta drifted into my lane for a second, and this came out of my mouth. I said, â€œworthless piece of shit.â€ I mean, what an indictment. What kind of a way is that to feel about another human being? â€œWorthless piece of shitâ€? Thatâ€™s somebodyâ€™s son. And things Iâ€™ve said to other people. I was once driving, and some guy in a pickup truck didâ€“ I donâ€™t remember, evenâ€“ And I yelled out my window, I said, â€œhey, fuck you!â€ Where outside of a car is that even nearly OK? If you were in an elevator And you were, like, right next to a personâ€™s body And, whatever, like, he leaned into you a little bit, Would you ever turn right to their face and go, â€œhey, fuck you!â€? â€œworthless piece of shit!â€ No. Literally zero people would ever do that, but put a couple of pieces of glass and some road between you, thereâ€™s nothing you would not say to them. â€œI hope you die!â€ I said that to a person. â€œI hope you die!â€ Why? â€™cause you made me go like this for half a second of my life. You tested my reflexes, and it worked out fine! So now I hope your kids grow up motherless!â€ I mean, what am I capable of? Iâ€™d like to think that Iâ€™m a nice person, But I donâ€™t know, man.qX	  â€œIf Murder Was Legalâ€
A lot of it is context. Thereâ€™s a lot of things I wonder if the world was different. Like, if murder was legal, I might have killed a few people. I donâ€™t know. Iâ€™d love to think, â€œI would never do that,â€ But we really need the law against murder For one simple reason. The law against murder Is the number-one thing preventing murder. Weâ€™d like to think itâ€™s â€™cause, Like, â€œI would never do that.â€ No. Itâ€™s â€™cause it really sucks getting caught murdering, a lot. If murder was legal, or just a misdemeanorâ€“ Like you get a thing in the mailâ€“ â€œshit, they had a camera there. Well.â€ If murder was legal, there would be so much murder. Regular people would murder. Murderers would murder even more, And then really nice, sweet people Would murder a few people, But nobody would murder no people. You wouldnâ€™t trust somebody who didnâ€™t murder If murder was legal. You wouldnâ€™t like them. â€œI never killed anybody.â€ â€œOK. Nice meeting you. Yecch, what a creep. â€œI mean, not even a hooker? Live a life. â€œwhatâ€™s wrong with that guy? Heâ€™s like a Mormon or some shit. I hate those guys.â€ â€œI think heâ€™s nice.â€ â€œshut up, Janet.â€ They would justâ€“ If murder was legal, there would be a lot of murder. Children would behave very differently Because mostly parents would be murdering their own kids, Thatâ€™s mostly what would happen if murder was legal. You know, youâ€™d go to a mall, thereâ€™d be, Like eight, different moms in the mall justâ€“ â€œI told you to stop it! You didnâ€™t listen to me!â€ Justâ€“pbbt! Thereâ€™d be justâ€“ Youâ€™d be stepping over dead kids. Thereâ€™d be, like, a new problem. â€œyou have to clean up your kids â€œwhen you kill them â€™cause itâ€™s gross. â€œitâ€™s bad for the environment. â€œif you murder your child in a public place, â€œplease use one of the red bags that are in the dispensers â€œevery three feet of America. â€œput your murdered child in the red bag â€œwith a logo of a murdered kid on it â€œnext to the other logo that tells you â€œnot to let your alive kid play with the plastic bag â€œbecause they might suffocate, In which case you could just leave them in the bag.â€ That is a whole bunch of horrible thoughts Right in a row, right in a row. That is a compressed area of bad thought.qXÆ  â€œOf Course, But Maybeâ€
You know, you have your bad thoughts. Hopefully you do good things. Everybody has a competition in their brain of good thoughts and bad thoughts. Hopefully, the good thoughts win. For me, I always have both. I have, like, the thing I believe, the good thingâ€“ Thatâ€™s the thing I believeâ€“ and then thereâ€™s this thing, and I donâ€™t believe it, but it is there. Itâ€™s always this thing and then this thing. Itâ€™s become a category in my brain That I call, â€œof courseâ€¦ But maybeâ€¦â€ Iâ€™ll give you an example, OK? Like, of course children who have nut allergies need to be protected, of course. We have to segregate their food from nuts, Have their medication available at all times, and anybody who manufactures or serves food needs to be aware of deadly nut allergies, of course, but maybeâ€¦ Maybe if touching a nut kills you, youâ€™re supposed to die. Of course not. Of course not. Of course not. Jesus. I have a nephew who has that. Iâ€™d be devastated if something happened to him, but maybeâ€¦ maybe if we all just do this for one year, weâ€™re done with nut allergies forever. No. Of course not. Of course, if youâ€™re fighting for your country and you get shot or hurt, itâ€™s a terrible tragedy, of course, of courseâ€¦ But maybeâ€¦ Maybe if you pick up a gun and go to another country and you get shot, itâ€™s not that weird. Maybe if you get shot by the dude you were just shooting at, Itâ€™s a tiny bit your fault. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Listen, listen. You all clapped for dead kids with the nuts. For kids dying from nuts, you applauded, So youâ€™re in this with me now. Do you understand? You donâ€™t get to cherry-pick. Those kids did nothing to you. Of course, of course slavery is the worst thing that ever happened. Of course it is, every time itâ€™s happenedâ€“ Black people in America, Jews in Egypt. Every time a whole race of people has been enslaved, itâ€™s a terrible, horrible thing, of courseâ€¦ But maybeâ€¦ Maybe every incredible human achievement in history was done with slaves. Every single thing where you go, â€œhow did they build those pyramids?â€ They just threw human death and suffering at them until they were finished. How did we traverse the nation with the railroad so quickly? We just threw Chinese people in caves and blew â€™em up and didnâ€™t give a shit what happened to them. Thereâ€™s no end to what you can do when you donâ€™t give a fuck about particular people. You can do anything. Thatâ€™s where human greatness comes from, is that weâ€™re shitty people, that we fuck others over. Even today, how do we have this amazing microtechnology? Because the factory where theyâ€™re making these, They jump off the fucking roof â€™cause itâ€™s a nightmare in there. You really have a choice. You can have candles and horses and be a little kinder to each other or let someone suffer immeasurably far away Just so you can leave a mean comment on YouTube while youâ€™re taking a shit.qXO   Thanks a lot, folks. You guys were great. Thank you very, very much. Thank you.qe.
